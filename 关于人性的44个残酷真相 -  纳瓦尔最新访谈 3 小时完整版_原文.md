发言人1   00:00
Happiness is being satish ed with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. It's success. What is done if . 

发言人2   00:08
i'm not sure that statement is true anymore like I made this time in a long time ago. And a lot of these things are just note to myself, and they're highly contextual. They come in the moment to live, in the moment happiness. 

发言人2   00:21
okay. So very complicated topic. But I was like the soccer story where he goes into the marketplace and they show him all these luxuries. 

发言人2   00:29
And fine reason, he says, how many things there are in this world that I do not want, and that's a form of freedom. So not wanting something is as good as having IT. In the old story with Alexander diagnosis, right? Alexander goes out and conquers the world that he meets. 

发言人2   00:43
Diameter is living in a barrel and diameter is says, get out of the way you're blocking my son and Alexander says, oh, how I wish how you know could be like diameter is in the next life and dynastic is that's a difference. I don't wish that I could so that says, wish to be Alexander so two pads to happiness and uh, one paris for success. You get what you want to satisfy your material needs or like diogenes, you just don't want in the first place. 

发言人2   01:10
And i'm not sure which one is more valid. And IT also depends to define success if the end goal is happiness, then why not cut to the chase and just go straight for IT? Uh, does being happy make you less successful? That is a conventional wisdom that may even be the practical earned experience of your reality. 

发言人2   01:28
You find that when you're a happy, you don't want anything so you don't get up and do anything. On the other hand, you know, you still got to do something. You are animal. 

发言人2   01:36
You're here. You're here to survive. You here to replicate your driven. 

发言人2   01:40
You're motivated. You're gonna something. You're not just going to sit there all day. Unlikely some people do. Maybe it's in their nature, but I think most people still want to act. They want to live in the arena. 

发言人2   01:51
I found for myself, as i've become uh, happier is a big word, but you know more peaceful, more calm, more present, more, uh, satisfied with what I have, uh, I still want to do things. I just want to do Better things. I want to do things that are more pure, more a line with, uh, what I think needs to be done and what I can uniquely do. So in that sense, I think that being happier can actually make you more successful, but your definition of successful will likely change along the way. 

发言人1   02:20
Is that a realization you think you could have gotten to how you have not had some success in the first place? 

发言人2   02:26
At least for me, I always wanted to take the path of material success first. I was not going to go be anesthetic and sit there and renounce everything that just seems too unreliable and too painful ah in the story of buda, he starts out as a prince and then he sees that it's all kind of meaningless because you're still gonna old and die and then he goes into the woods looking for something more. I'll take the happy route that involves a material success. Thank you. 

发言人1   02:54
I think it's quicker in some ways. One of your insights far easy to achieve our material desires, that is, to announce them IT . 

发言人2   03:04
depends on the person. But II think you have to try the path. If you want something, go get IT. Uh, no, I, I, I quip that the reason to win the game is to be free of IT. So you you play the games, you win the games and then you get hopefully get bored of the games. You don't want to just keep looping on the same game over and over, although a lot of these games are very enticing and have many levels in a relatively open ended, uh, and then you become free of the game, uh, in a sense that you're no longer trying to win IT. You know you can win IT and either you move to a different game or you play the game . 

发言人1   03:37
for the sheer joy of IT yeah, you another one of yours. Most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term, so I can get paid in the long term. I think classic winning the Marshall test, yeah, on a daily basis. 

发言人1   03:49
But there's an interesting chAllenge where I think people need to avoid becoming AA suffering addict, sort of using suffering as the proxy for progress as opposed to the outcome of the suffering, right? It's like I was in pain not eating the marshmallow. I was in pain doing this work. I have attached well being and satisfaction to pain, not to what the pain gets me on the other side of IT. 

发言人2   04:15
If you define pain as physical pain, then it's a real thing that happens. And you can ignore IT. But that's not what we mean by suffering. 

发言人2   04:22
Suffering is mostly mental anguish and mental pain and IT just means you don't want to do the task at hand. Uh, if you were fine doing the task at hand, then wouldn't be sufficing. And then the question is, what's more effective to suffer along the way or just to interpret IT in the way that is not suffering. 

发言人2   04:37
You hear from a lot of successful people, they look back and they say all the journey was a fun part, right? That was actually the entertaining part I should have enjoy IT more. It's a common regret. Uh, there's a little thought exercise i'll like to do, which is you can go back into your own life and try to put yourself in the exact position you are in five years ago, ten years ago, fifteen years ago, twenty years ago. 

发言人2   05:00
And you try to remember, okay, who was I weird? What was I doing? What was I feeling? All of my emotions, all of my objectives, and really, really try to transport yourself back and see if there's any advice to give yourself anything you do differently. 

发言人2   05:12
Now you don't have new information. Don't pretend you could have gone back in. You bought a stock or bought big corner, whatever. But just knowing what you know now in terms of you, your temperament and a little bit of age related experience, how would you've done things differently? And I think it's a worthwhile excise to do. So don't let me rob you of the conclusion but i'll tell you for me ah, I would have done everything the same except I would have done IT with less anger, less emotion, less internal suffering because I was option AI wasn't necessary and I would argue that someone who can do the job, uh, at least peacefully, but maybe happily, is going to be more effective than someone who has a nessy emotional . 

发言人1   05:55
and where you end up with a series of miserable successes, right? The outcome may have been the same, but the entire experience of getting that and in the journey . 

发言人2   06:04
is not only the reward, the journey, the thing there is, you know, even success is human nature to bank IT very, very quickly, right? Because a Normal loop that we run through as you sit around your board, then you want something, then when you want something, you decide you're not going to be happy until you get that thing. Then you start your out of suffering or anticipation while you strive to get that thing. 

发言人2   06:27
If you get that thing, then you get used to IT and then you get bored again. Then a few months later, you want something else. And if you don't get IT, then you're unhappy for a bit, then you get over IT, then you want something else, right? That's the Normal cycle. 

发言人2   06:38
So whether you're happy, you're unhappy at the end, IT tends not to last. Now I don't want to be global and say that, oh, there is no point in making money or be successful. There absolutely is. 

发言人2   06:49
Money solves all your money problems. So IT is good to have money. Um that said, there are those uh those stories. I think those studies, I don't know how real these are, all these site studies don't, but it's a fun, fun little study that shows that a people who break their back and people who win the lottery are back to their baseline happiness two years later. Again, I don't know this entirely true. 

发言人2   07:11
I think money can buy you happiness if you earned IT, because then along the way, you have both pride and confidence in yourself and you have a sense of accomplishment and you, you know, set out to do something, and you are right. So II bet that lingers. And then as I said, money solves money problems. 

发言人2   07:26
I don't want to be too glad about IT, but I would say in general this this loop that we runs through um of desire, dopamine, fulfilled men, unfulfilled men, you have to enjoy the journey. The journey is all there is right. Nine and nine percent time was spent on the journey. So what kind of a journey is that if you're . 

发言人1   07:43
not going to enjoy IT, how do you sure cut that desire contract? 

发言人2   07:47
You could focus you could decide that I don't want most things. I think we have a lot of unnecessary desires that we just pick up everywhere. We have opinions on everything, judgements and everything. 

发言人2   07:59
So I think just knowing that those are the source of unhappiness，uh, will make you be choosy about your desires. And Frankly, if you want to be successful, you have to be choose about your desirs. You have to focus. 

发言人1   08:09
you can't be graded. 

发言人2   08:10
Everything you can be great. Everything you to waste energy and . 

发言人1   08:14
waste time is famous, worthwhile. Go. 

发言人2   08:18
uh, IT gets you invite you to Better parties, gets you to Better restaurants. A fame. So fame is this funny thing where a lot of people know you but you don't know them. 

发言人2   08:29
And a IT does get you put in pedestal IT can get you what you want at a at a distance. So I wouldn't say it's worthless. Obviously people wanted for a reason um it's high status. So IT attracts the opposite sex, especially for many attracts a women uh that said, IT is high cost IT means you have no privacy um you do have weird and little tics. Uh you do get hit up a lot for weird things and you're on a stage so you're forced to perform so you're force to be consistent with your past proclamations and actions. And you gonna have haters and all that concise, but the fact that we do IT, the fact that we all seem to want IT, means that IT would be discontinuous to say, I don't know, i'm famous, but you don't want to be famous that said, I think fame like anything else, is best produced as a or pursued as a by product of something potentially more worthwhile um wanting to be famous and craving to be famous and being famous for being famous. 

发言人1   09:25
These are sort of traps fame for . 

发言人2   09:27
some sake yeah exactly. So it's Better than its own thing. Uh, so for example, own respect in the as you do things that are good for the tribe, uh, who are the most famous people in human history? 

发言人2   09:37
Uh, there are you know there there are people who sort of transcended themself, the budders and the jesus in the mohamad of the world. Who else is famous? Uh, the artists are famous. 

发言人2   09:47
You know, art last for a long time. The scientists are famous. They discover thing. The congress are famous, present because they conquered for their tribe. There was someone that they were fighting for. 

发言人2   09:57
So generally the higher up by doing things for greater and greater groups of people, even though IT may be considered tyrannical or negative, like you know, JK as famous, but uh, to the mongols, he was doing good to the rest of them, not so much. A the higher level you're Operating at, the more people you're taking care of, the more you sort of earned respect and fame. And I think those are good reasons to be famous. 

发言人2   10:22
If fame is empty, if your fame is just because your name showed up in a lot of places or your face showed up in a lot of places, then that's a holo fame. And I think deep down you will know that. And so be fragile and you'll be afraid of losing IT, and then you'll be force to perform. 

发言人2   10:36
So the kind of fame that uh, pure actors and celebrities have, I wouldn't want, but the kind of fame that's earn because you did something useful. A why dodge that? No, you can. 

发言人1   10:47
This is a chAllenge, I think, especially if people make very loud public proclamations about things mentioned there about um you're almost a hostage to the things that used to say that um being able to update your opinions and change your mind you looks very similar to the internet as hypocrisy does you know the difference between me saying something in the past and saying something different now is perhaps i've learned, perhaps i've updated my believing, right? But so few people do IT in a legitimate way. 

发言人1   11:16
I think that the grifter shell you see, this is the smoking gun that shows that he didn't really believe that thing all along. And yeah, II went to a retreat in LA. A couple of years ago and there was a guy that used to follow the but big business and productivity advice content creator really, really successful. And you just told this step back from everything like monk mode and focused on his business and asking wine, he said, I started feeling like I had to live up to in private the things that I was saying in public. right? 

发言人2   11:48
Yeah, it's a what was that? Who said he was a mankind? That foolish consistency of how goblin of little minds, right? But essentially, look, all this is all learning is error correction, right? Every knowledge creation system works through correcting errors, making guesses and correcting error. So by definition, if you're learning, you can be wrong most the time, and you will be updating your payers. 

发言人2   12:11
And so for example, later this jeroen, an podcasting I was eight or nine years ago and people will call out like the one thing that didn't turn out to be correct and it's just like they're just beat on IT because IT IT helps them, in their mind, raise their status a little bit. Aha, I caught him in an error. Well, I think if you catch someone in the britain lie where there's believe one thing and they say another, that's legit. 

发言人2   12:32
That's a character flaw. Dishonors be lying. But on the other hand, if they just made a guest at something and they got a wrong, and by the way, most leads about the AIAGI think and I think i'm still right about with a different story um people who think we have achieved agi just failed toru tests from their side. 

发言人2   12:49
It's funny how people latch on to single proclaim tions, but the reality is all of us are dynamic systems. We're always changing. We're always learning. 

发言人2   12:59
We're always grow. And uh, hopefully we're correcting errors. But you don't want to be doing is lying in public so that because you're you're trying to look good. 

发言人2   13:07
And I think people can smell that what this world really lacks right now is authenticity. And because everybody wants something, they want to be seen as something, they want to be something that they're not. And so you do catch a lot of people, uh, saying things that they don't really believe. And I think people are . 

发言人1   13:25
very sensitive. Bulls shit radars have become hyper sized to try and work out whether or not this person means . 

发言人2   13:32
to a lot of people along most of us, along most of the time, especially in . 

发言人1   13:37
any new endear wrong t exactly. 

发言人2   13:40
So I think, I think that's a big difference. If someone is wrong, no big deal, as long as they have a genuine reason for saying what they are saying, who are believing what they're believing. But if they are lying to elevate the status of their appearance, to live up to some expectation, that's the mistake. And this a mistake, not just for the listener to mistake for themselves, because then you're onna, get trapped in a whole mirror s you yourself, or going be consistent with your past. 

发言人1   14:04
proclaim tion. So if you're lying to, oh, you going that's right. 

发言人2   14:10
Yeah it's it's like, was that line this you you're basically trying to impress people who, you know, don't care about you. 

发言人1   14:18
So and I don't like the real you, and if they saw the real you, they wlink care. And the people who would like the real, you don't get to see the real use. So they pass you by. 

发言人2   14:25
right? You only want to respect to the very, very few people that you respect, trying to demand respect from the masses as a fools are in. 

发言人1   14:35
Say this games, the a lure of a cruel, whether it's fame, actual fame or just the competition comparison trap is always there. There's a real draw of being swayed by social approval. How should people learn to get less distracted by state scams in that way? 

发言人2   14:54
I think IT IT just helps to see that status games don't matter as much as they used to in all society that go back country, gathered times, there is no thing as wealth you just had you could Carry. There was no stored wealth. So wealth games didn't really exist to wealth creation games, all that exists to status games. 

发言人2   15:12
If you are a high status, then you got what little was available first um but even back then, you had to earn your status by taking care of the tribe. Uh now we have wealth creation where you can actually create a product or service, you can scale that product or service, you can provide abundance for a lot of people. Uh, and that's not zero sum. 

发言人2   15:30
That's a positive sum game. I can be wealthy. You can be wealthy. We can create things together. 

发言人2   15:35
And clearly, since we are all collectively far, far wealthier than we were in hunter gather at times, uh, wealth creation is positive, but status is limited. There's limited status to go around. It's a ranking letter to hierarchy. 

发言人2   15:47
And so IT to rise in status, somebody else has a lower status. Now you can have multiple kinds of status, so you can expand some kinds of status is, but it's not like wealth creation. We can go infinitely where we can all be, you living in the stars and moon bases or mars colonies or what have you so just realized the status games are inherently limited. 

发言人2   16:06
They're always combat of um there always require uh, direct combat. Where is wealth creation? Games can be just you're creating products. You don't have to fight anybody else. Yes, in the marketplace, your product has succeed, but that's not quite the same as uh, effective against other people are being angry, other people feeling pushed down or pushed up or having a beef with somebody. So I would argue that word creation games are both more pleasant, uh, their positive some and they actually have a concrete matera returns if you have more money. 

发言人1   16:37
you can buy me change state. Actually. 

发言人2   16:41
yeah, it's vae in is fuzzy. Now, you see, people get rich. They have money. 

发言人2   16:46
What do they want? They want status. So they go to hollywood, start starting in movies. They don't attn non profits. They go to can or devils or what to have you um and they start trying to trade the money for status. So you know people always want what they don't have. 

发言人2   16:58
And we are evolutionary hardwired for status because as I said, wealth creation didn't really exist until the agricultural revolution when you could store grain. And then the industrial revolution took IT to another level and not the information age has taken to yet another level. But there's never been an easier time to make money. 

发言人2   17:15
Yes, it's still hard, but there's never been easier time to create wealth because there's so much leveraged out there, there's so much opportunity. You still have to go find IT. It's not easy. 

发言人2   17:23
It's not going to fall in your lap and you have to learn something and know something and do something interesting. But nevertheless, it's possible to many more people. Few hundred years ago, you were born to surf. 

发言人2   17:33
You're going to die surf. There was almost no way out of that. That's changed. And so I would argue that you're Better off focusing on wealth games and status games. If you're trying to build up, for example, you're following on a social network and get famous and then get rich of being famous, that's a much harder path than getting rich first and then go for your fame afterwards would be my advice. 

发言人1   17:55
Well, a lot of people do that. As he said, it's funny how a people who have achieved such a level of wealth you don't think why do you need the status given that most people use status to then trying cash to achieve wealth if you've achieved sucky money already, if you're post money or uh asset heavy as it's known um why you trying to go in the other direction? What as you said, because we've got an illustrious history biologically of wanting status and wealth is kind of not it's new. 

发言人2   18:23
The wealth is h something that you have to understand more intellectually. Yeah, there's a physical component, more food, more survival. But to truly understand the effects and the powers in the abilities and limitations and the advances and disadvantage is a wealth you have to use your real car. 

发言人1   18:41
tex, a lot more is an the reason to play the game is to win the game and be done with IT is harder to win and be done with for status than IT is for wealth. 

发言人2   18:49
That's a good observation. I had thought that through, but you're right yeah I think that's right. I think you people will always want more statius. Uh, but I think you can be satisfied at a certain level of wealth well as well. 

发言人1   19:00
You always have this sort of sense and this is what leader boards are. This is IT is zero sum right? And IT is, I guess, you know the forbes richest people on the planet yeah. 

发言人2   19:14
that was hard to climb the latter on. But the fact that, for example, itunes and youtube can put you in competition against your contemporary every single day and make you go up and down and show you . 

发言人1   19:26
likes and comments . 

发言人2   19:27
and rating this exactly, keep you running on that treatment forever. 

发言人1   19:31
Jimmy cr has this cool idea where he says trajectory is more important than position. So if you are nine hundred and one in the world, but last year you are number two hundred verses, you number two in the world, last year you number one, there is this sense of the deceleration is very, very tangible. It's why I going to goes back to evolution. 

发言人2   19:50
And something that is bleeding eventually dies. Unless you stop the bleating, you're hard wired not to lose what you. And because we evolved in conditions we were so close to just not surviving a, you don't want to give anything up. It's hardwired into us to not give anything up. 

发言人1   20:07
So you grab tightly. That's right. If you struggle to stay a sleep because your body gets too hot or too cold, this is going to help just add an eight sleep pod for ultra mattress. 

发言人1   20:16
Like a fitted sheet, they will automatically cool down or warm up each side of your bed up to twenty degrees. It's got integrated senses to track your sleep time, your sleep faces, your hv, you're snaring and your heart rate with nineteen nine percent accuracy. IT even starts cooling or heating your bed an hour before you get into IT. 

发言人1   20:33
That is why eight sleep has been clinically proven to increase total lead up to one hour every night. Best of all, we've got a thirty day sleep trial, so you can buy IT and sleep on IT for twenty nine night. And if you don't like IT, they will give you your money back. 

发言人1   20:45
Plus the ship internationally right now, you can get three hundred and fifty dollars off the pod for ultra by going to the link in the description below are heading to eight sleep dot com, such as modern wisdom, and using the code, modern wisdom a checking that EIGHT sleep dot com, such a modern wisdom and modern wisdom a checkout. The worst outcome in the world is not having self. Estee. 

发言人2   21:07
yeah, it's a tough one. I look at the people and I don't want to end anybody, but look at the people who don't like themselves and that's the toughness slot because they always rest with themselves and it's hard enough to face the outside world um and no one's going to like you more than you like yourself. So if you are struggling with yourself, then the outside world becomes an insurmountable chAllenge. 

发言人2   21:30
And it's hard to say why people have low self team in might be genetics IT, might just be circumstantial. Lot of times, I think, is because they just weren't unconditionally love to the child. And that sort of seizin at a deep core level. 

发言人2   21:43
Um but self steam issues can be the most limiting. One interesting thought is that you know to some extent self fest team as a reputation you have with yourself. Um you are watching yourself at all the times you know what you're doing and you have your own moral code. 

发言人2   21:58
Everyone has a different moral de, but if you don't live up to your own moral code, the same code that you hold others too uh IT will damage yourself esteem so perhaps one way to build up your self as team is to live up to your own code very rigorously, have one, and then live up to IT. Another way to raise yourself as team might be to do things for others. If I look back on my life, and you know, what are the moments that i'm actually proud of, there is very foreign between. 

发言人2   22:25
It's not that often, it's not the things you would expect. It's not the material success is not having learned this thing or that it's when I made a sacrifice for somebody or something that I loved. And that's when I am actually, ironically, most proud. 

发言人2   22:38
Now that's an explicit mental exercise, but i'll bet you at some level and recording that implicitly. So that tells me that even if I am not being loved, in the way to create love is to give love to to express love through sacrifice, through duty. And so I think doing things like that can build up yourself a team really fast. 

发言人1   22:54
It's interesting when you talk about sacrifice, because a lot of the time, people so I sacrifice so much for my job like, yeah, but that was you sacrificing something that you wanted less for, something that you wanted more as supposed to genuinely taking some sort of cost uh I wonder whether if self a steam is you adheres ing to your internal your actions into your values align ing um even when it's difficult, perhaps even more so it's difficult. 

发言人1   23:21
I wonder whether there is a Price that people who are more inro's cable, high integrity pay because think, well, you've got this heavy asset of overheads. Did you need to pay in some way? Well, if being . 

发言人2   23:37
ethically were profitable, everybody would do IT right. So, uh, you at some level doesn't involve a sacrifice uh but that sacrifice can also be thought of as you're thinking for the long term read in the short term um if for example, the virtues are the set of uh virtues, a set of belief that everybody y's society followed them as individuals, IT would lead to win win outcomes for everybody. 

发言人2   24:00
So if I am honest and you are honest, then we can do business more easily. We can interact more easily because we can trust each other. So even though there might be a few liars in the system, as long as there aren't too many liars and too many cheaters, uh, a hydrous society where everybody's honest, Better off. 

发言人2   24:15
And I think a lot of the virtues work this way, right? If I don't go on sleeping with your wife and you don't sleep with mine, you know, if I don't take all the food is at the table first and so on, then we all get along Better and we can play win win games in game theory, the most famous game as prisoners delima. But that's all about everybody cheating in the nasty galliera um the stable equilibrium um there is everybody cheats. 

发言人2   24:35
And you're fort the only way you can be. You can play a win, win game as if you have long term iterated moves. But that's not actually the most common game played in society. 

发言人2   24:43
The most common game players, one called the tags hunt, where if we CoOperate we can bring down a big stag and both have big dinners. But if we don't CoOperate, then we have to go hunt like rabbits and we each have small dinners. So most of um in that game has two stable equal liberals. 

发言人2   24:58
And one could be where both hunting the rabbit in, one could be where we are hunting the stacks. So the hydrous society is a more virtuous society, where I can trust you to come hunt the stag with me and open time and do the work and divided properly. So you want to live in a system where everybody has their own set of virtues and follows them, and then we all win. 

发言人2   25:18
But I would argue, you don't need to do that for sacrifice. You don't need to do that for other people. You can do IT just purely for yourself. You will have higher self steam. You will attract other high virtue people. 

发言人1   25:29
Does I go to stag hunt with me? 

发言人2   25:31
correct? Yeah, that's right. And if you are the kind of person, if you're the kind of person who long term signals ethics and virtues, then you'll attract other people whose are ethical and virtuous. 

发言人2   25:42
Whether if you are a shark, you will eventually find itself swiming entirely among sharks. And that's an unpleasant existence. But again, this goes back to the quill vin of the marsh mono test. And by the . 

发言人1   25:54
marsh mono test, does not replicate vacation Prices. 

发言人2   25:57
But IT is about trading off short term for the long term. Uh, and so I think for a lot of these so called virtues, there are long term selfish reasons to be virtuous. 

发言人1   26:08
yeah. Did you deal with self doubt in the past? Is that something that was a hurdle feed overcome? 

发言人2   26:17
Yes, I no, I think I dealt with self out out in the sense that, oh, I don't know what i'm doing and I need to figure that out. But I didn't doubt myself in the way of somebody else knows Better than me for me or that, you know, i'm an idiot, i'm not worthwhile or anything that II guess I had the benefit of. I grew up with a lot of love, like the people around me love me unconditionally. And so that just gave me a lot of confidence, uh, not the kind of confidence that would say I have the answer, but the kind of confidence that I will figure that out and I know what I want or only I am a good arbitrary of what I want . 

发言人1   26:53
yeah that level of south belief, I suppose, allows you to determine what is IT that matters to me, myself, a team. Should I chase this thing or not, I can make a fed judgment on that is opposed to being so way. But it's such a good point about even if you think you're not consciously logging the stuff that you're doing, there is some that in the back of the amount is at the diamond. Is that what the uh ancient . 

发言人2   27:17
greeks or something is? Yeah yeah also in computer science like concept of diamond, which is a uh a program is always running in the background. You can see IT OK um but yeah probably comes from the ancient greek demon um but yeah I what you know that you don't even know you know is far greater than what you know you know right you can even articulate most of the things you know there are feelings you have that have no words for them. 

发言人2   27:43
There are thoughts you have that are felt, the body or subconsciously that you never articulate to yourself. You don't you can't articulate the rules of grammar yet. You exercise them effortlessly when you speak. 

发言人2   27:54
So I would argue that you're implicit knowledge, and your knowledge that is unknown to yourself is far greater than the now as you can articular that you can communicate. And so at some level, you're always watching yourself. That's so your consciousness is right, is the thing that's watching everything, including your mind, including your body. So if you want to a, have high self team, then earn your own self respect. 

发言人1   28:18
I had this idea, the internal golden rule. So the golden rule says, treat others the way that you should be treated. You want to be treated. The internal golden rule says, treat yourself like others should have treated you and IT was AA repost to maybe people that didn't grow up with unconditional love yeah in that way. 

发言人2   28:38
On the love thing, one of the interesting things about love is you can try to remember the feeling of being loved. So go back to when someone wasn't love with you or someone still love you, and like, really remember that feeling, like really sit with IT and try to requite IT within yourself and then go to the feeling of you, you loving someone and when you were in love. And i'm not even talking about romantic love necessarily. So be little careful there. I'm talking more about . 

发言人1   29:04
like love and sometimes get complex. If you're talking about past romantic love. 

发言人2   29:07
right, a sibling or a child, there's something like that or a parent and think about when you felt love toward someone or something, and now which is Better. And I would argue that the feeling of being in love is actually more exaggerating. The feeling of being loved, being loved is a little coin, is a little too sweet. 

发言人2   29:27
You can want to push the person away, is a little embarrassing. And you know that if that person is too much into IT that you feel constrained. On the other hand, the feeling of being in love is very expensive and it's very open. 

发言人2   29:36
IT actually makes you a Better version of yourself. IT makes you want to be a Better person. And so you can create love anytime you want is just that craving to receive IT. That's the problem. 

发言人1   29:47
The most expensive trade is pride. 

发言人2   29:49
How come? Oh, that was a recent one. A, I, I tweet that just because I think that a pride is the enemy of learning. 

发言人2   29:57
So when I look at my friends and colleagues, the ones who are still stuck in the past and have grown the least are the ones who are the proud because they sort of feel like they already had the answers, and so they don't want to correct themselves publicly. And so this goes back to the fame conversation. You get locked into something you said that made you famous. You're known for that, and now you want to pivot or change. So pride prevents you from saying i'm wrong. 

发言人1   30:21
X IT could be as simple as you're . 

发言人2   30:23
trading stocks and then you don't admit you are wrong, so you hang until allows the trade uh IT could be that you are made a decision to uh you know marry someone or move somewhere or enter a profession that doesn't work out. Then you don't admit that you are wrong so you get stuck in IT. It's mostly about getting trapped in local maxima as supposed to going back down and climbing up the mountain again. 

发言人1   30:46
And that's why it's an expensive trade because you continue to need to repay . 

发言人2   30:49
IT in one former another yeah, you're just stuck at a sub optimal point. It's gona cost you money, is going to cost you success and time and time. Uh, the great artists always have this ability to start, whether it's polite ma or madona or youtube and updating myself a little bit. 

发言人2   31:05
But even the great entrepreneurs there just always will start over. I'm always struck by the elon musk story where no, he he did paypal as extent comercial。He actually was his his financial institution that got emerging to paypal. 

发言人1   31:19
Good that you ve got the domain . 

发言人2   31:21
park that consistent. He's been using IT for quite a while um and he said is something like along the lines of um I made two hundred million dollars in the sala paypal I put one hundred million dollars in the space sex eight tested twenty into solar city and that to borrow money for rent right this guy is a potential is taker. He's always would start over. He doesn't have any pride about being seen as successful as being seen as a failure. 

发言人1   31:44
He's wanted to put IT all back himself again. 

发言人2   31:47
each back himself again each time. But the key thing is he's always willing to start over right. Even now when he sort of made his his new startup as a USA, right, he's basically trying to fix IT like he would fix one of his startups. 

发言人2   32:00
And I think that is a wilderness to look like a fool, and that is a wilderness to start over. A lot of people just don't have that. They become successful. 

发言人2   32:07
They become ritually become famous, and that sit their stuck. They don't want to go back to zero. And creating anything great requires zero to one. And that means you go back to zero. And that's really painful and hard . 

发言人1   32:19
to do talking about risk, something I been thinking about a lot to do with you any moment when you're not having a good time, when you're not really happy, you're not doing anyone any favors in lots of people have become unusually familiar with suffering silently in that sort of a way of not having a high bar for your expectation for a quality of life. Yeah, a lot of this disturb . 

发言人2   32:46
ming yourself into a bad outcome because you think that somehow suffering is a glorious or that IT makes you a Better person. Or my equip was, if you're so smart, weren't you happy? Why can you figure that one out? Um the reality is you can be smart, happy. 

发言人2   33:01
There are planning of people in human history who are smart, happy. Uh and I think I just starts with saying, yeah you know what? I'm going to be happy. 

发言人2   33:08
IT was a guy that I met in thailand a long time ago and um he is to work for tony Robins you know he a great attitude and uh, we were sitting around and he said you uh he said I realized one day that someone out there had to be the happiest person in the world like that. That person just has to exist. He said, why not me? I'll take on that burden. 

发言人2   33:30
I'll be that guy and I heard I like, well, that's pretty good. That's a good frame, right? He knew how to reframe things. 

发言人2   33:36
And so I think a lot of happiness is just a choice, uh, in the sense that you may first you just identify yourself as actually i'm going to be a person's going to be happy. I want to figure out out and you just figured out along the way, you're not gna lose your other product actions. You're not gona lose your ambition or desire for success. I think a lot of people have this fear that, oh, if i'm happy that I want want to be successful, no, you will just want to do things that are more aligned with a happy version of you, and you'll be successful with those things and blame me, the happy version if you use not going to look back at the unhappy version and say. 

发言人1   34:07
a man that I was. 

发言人2   34:08
You're actually trying to be successful. So you'll be happy if you get in the backwards. 

发言人1   34:12
You you unlocked one of my trap cards, one of my favorite insights that is that we sacrifice the thing we want for the thing that supposed to get IT. So we sacrifice happiness in order to be successful, so that when we're finally sufficiently successful, we can actually be happy. And if you have some sort of simultaneous equation, you just have stripped success off from both sides. 

发言人2   34:33
At least in my own life, I have not found that to be a trade off. If anything, I have found that the happier I get, the more I am going to do the things that I am good at and aligned with, and that will make me even happier. And so I actually end up more successful, not less. 

发言人1   34:48
The aligned with thing is interesting. I mean, to try and put this across as delicately as I can, I would say, from the bit of time that we spent together, you have a really interesting trait of holistic selfishness. Your sort of prepared to put yourself first seem largely unphased by saying or doing things that might result in other people feeling a little bit awkward if it's truthful for you like an apologetically self prioritizing, I guess. Yeah, I think everybody . 

发言人2   35:19
is maybe unapologetic is the part that's that's relatively, uh, rare, but I think everybody puts themselves first. That's just human nature. You're here because you survive your separate organism. 

发言人1   35:30
That's interesting maybe, but I know we like to virtue . 

发言人2   35:33
signal on pretend that we're doing you for each other how how many . 

发言人1   35:36
times to somebody said yes, of course i'd love to come to the wedding like I don't want to be at the fucking in wedding here how many times to somehow you doing today? I don't tell you how, but this is my point. So I don't think you're necessary right with that. I think that people do I don't think they put themselves first. I sometimes think that they they compromise what IT is that they want in order to appease socially what's in front of them. 

发言人2   35:58
Yeah, I just viewed as your waste. Everyone's wasting their time on IT don't do something you don't want to do. why? Why are you wasting the time? They're AA little time on this earth. 

发言人2   36:08
Life goes fast. What is four thousand weeks? That's your life span. Um and and yes, we hear that but we don't remember that. But uh, I guess i'm came me aware of how little time I have. I'm just not gona wasted. 

发言人1   36:19
How have you got more comfortable at being the unapologetic self prioritizing? Yes. 

发言人2   36:28
i've i've totally more and more ruthless on IT mainly IT said, I see or hear people's freedom and then that liberates me further. So I read a uh I read a blog post by, uh p marka AK mark and recent race that don't keep a schedule. And I took back to heart. 

发言人2   36:44
So I delete my calendar. I don't keep a schedule. I tried to remember IT all of my head. If I can't remember IT, i'm not going to yeah exactly to look things up at the last minute uh so but ironically only enough mark himself follows that but he made the point ah I read a little story by jack dorsey doing all his business of his uh iphone and ipad and not even going into a mac and I said, OK, I want to do that. I'm going to Operate through text messaging and put nasty feel . 

发言人1   37:11
like more freedom IT . 

发言人2   37:12
does yeah because you're on the go um so I have a nasty email auto responder that says I don't check email and don't text neither right? If you need to find me, you'll find me. Obviously, some of this is in the luxury of success, but some of these habits are adopted long before actually the hostile email auto respond to started. 

发言人2   37:30
I used to own the domain iglesia coffee. I don't do coffee. I can to reply from that email, uh, just so people who get the point, but I stop being rude about IT. Now I just ghost, I just disappear. Um my wife knows not to ever uh, book or schedule me for anything not like I expected to go to couples dinner and expected to go to birthdays and expected go to weddings. If somebody tries to row into having me show up, he says he makes own . 

发言人1   37:58
decisions. You have serendipity and way that no. 

发言人2   38:01
no, i'm fring. All my time of my entire life is serendib I get to interact with whoever I want. 

发言人1   38:07
whenever I want to hear the invite, but make the decision because if you don't know if the fewer things and kind of your shaming that you know what's best . 

发言人2   38:14
to anything in the future. So i'll say, okay, if that thing is interesting, i'll see if I can get in that day when i'm in the mood. But there is nothing worse than something coming up that your past self committed you to present doesn't . 

发言人1   38:27
want you yeah and then IT destroys . 

发言人2   38:29
your entire calendar. IT destroys your day because there's like this one hour slot. What is sitting like a turtle on my calendar that I have to like scheduled by whole day around. 

发言人2   38:38
I can't do anything twenty years before the twenty minutes afterwards, even for phone calls. If someone wants to your phone call, say, okay, just text me when you're free out, text you are free and i'll just do IT on the fly. It's a much Better way living than this over the scheduled know, call that com or I call whatever the over . 

发言人1   38:52
scheduled life is not worth living. It's not I think it's . 

发言人2   38:55
terrible way to live life. That's not how we evolve. It's not how we grew up now, how we were as children. Hopefully, unless you have a helicopter parent or a tiger mom, your natural orders freedom. Uh, I had a friend who uh, said to me once, you know ah I never wanted have to be at a specific place at a specific time and I was like, oh my god, that's freedom when I . 

发言人1   39:19
heard that that change my alarm yes. 

发言人2   39:23
i'm alarm clock today I did set my life just I won't but just so you know, I set the alarm clock from eleven AM in case I was stricken with the flu. I was going to set my five clock for AM or I am and short enough I got up many hours before that yeah um but IT was sort of a backup emergency alarm in fact, sometimes where something that I need to do, I don't want to look at a calendar. So I just set alarm for IT . 

发言人1   39:49
just sitting sink a little bit more into that. I kind of love that fuckyou energy, that self prioritising energy because I think people rationally love the idea i'm going to do what only I want to do, even if you've got the . 

发言人2   40:03
level freedom fuckyou energy, in the sense that I think everyone should live their life that way to the greatest extent possible. Obviously, we have a requirements around work and obligations that are genuinely important to us but don't fit away your life on randomly scheduled things and are things that are an important don't matter and events and weddings and you know tedious dinners with tedious people that you don't want to go to. 

发言人2   40:27
To the extent you can bring freedom into your lives optimized for that, you actually be more productive. You won't just be happier, more free. You will be more productive because then you can focus on what is in front of you, whatever. The biggest problem of that day, when I wake up in the morning, the first four hours are when I have the most energy, and that's when I wanted solve all the hard problems. 

发言人2   40:46
And the next four hours are when I kind of want to, you know, do some more outdoors the activities, or I want to work out, or maybe I can, you know, have some meetings, but i'll try to do those last second based on whatever the day's party is. Demand the last four hours. I kind of want to wind down, and I want to hang out with the kids, and I want to play games. 

发言人2   41:04
I read a book or something like that, so having that flexibility and freedom is really important so you can just put whatever is most needed into the slot at that moment. Uh, and instead, if I have like a meeting at two PM, and then I have to like get a thing in some emails done. I put that after six PM on rushing, i'm not going be productive. I'm not going to be. 

发言人1   41:26
uh, you certain ly not free. 

发言人2   41:27
you know, i'm definitely ough free. But also an another thing that I really believe is that inspiration is perhaps act on that immediately. So when you're inspired red to do something, do that thing. If I inspired to write a blog post, I want to do at that moment if I inspired red to send a tweet. And when I do at that moment, if inspired to solve a problem, do that moment, if I inspired to read a book, I want to read the right. 

发言人2   41:46
Then, if I inspire to solve a problem, to solve IT right there, if I want to learn something I do at the moment of curiosity, the moment the curiosity arrives, I go learn that thing immediately. I downal the book, I get on google, I get on ChatGPT, whatever. I will figure that thing out on the spot. 

发言人2   42:00
And that's when the learning happens. IT doesn't happen because of schedule time, because I ve set in our side, because when that time arrives and I been a different mood, I just want to do something different. So I think that sponsor is really important. You're gone to learn in best when you're having fun, when you generally are enjoying the process, not when you're forced to sit there and do IT how much you remember from school. You know, you were forced to learn geography, history, mathematics on this schedule at this time, according person didn't happen. 

发言人2   42:26
All the stuff that sticks with you is you learned IT when you wanted to, when you genuinely have a desire and that freedom, that ability to act on something the moment you want to, is so liberating that most of us go through our lives with a very, very little taste. Live your entire life that way. That is a recipe for happiness. 

发言人1   42:44
IT feels like efficiency that that you have. Also, you have the . 

发言人2   42:47
inspiration that is going to be the most . 

发言人1   42:49
frictionless time to ever do that particular task. Oh, i've had the inspiration to do that. I'll put that often until the time when I no longer really want to do quite so much. And while I do want to do that thing, i'll do something else that I needed to do because it's on the schedule. 

发言人2   43:02
IT doesn't not work. Procrastination, because you don't want to do that thing right now. You want to do something else, to do that, something else. I reject this frame that efficiency and productivity and success are counter to happiness and freedom. They actually go together. 

发言人1   43:15
So the happier you are. 

发言人2   43:17
the more you can sustain doing something, the more likely you are going to do something that will in turn make you even happier. And you continue to do IT you at work. Everybody else. The more free you are, the Better you can allocate your time, and the less you caught up in a web of obligations and commitments, and the more you can focus on the task at hand. 

发言人1   43:33
In other news, this episode is brought you by function. Staying on top of your health requires more than just an annual physical, which is why I pony with function. They are run lab tests twice year to track over a hundred biomes and monitored for early signs of thousands of diseases. 

发言人1   43:49
They even scream for fifty types of cancer, that stage one, which is five times more data than you get from an annual physical. You receive insights from a team of expert physicians who provided detail, written clinical summary for our observations and then phone consultations for any critical findings. Getting these lab tests, sun would usually cost thousands, but with function IT is only four hundred in one thousand nine dollars. 

发言人1   44:08
And right now you can get the exact same blood panels that I get. And by pass their weight list by going to the link in the description below are heading to function health top com slash modern wisdom that's function health点com slash modern wisdom。This is related to another inside of you is the less you want something, the less you're thinking about IT, the less you're obsessing over IT, the more you're going to do IT in a nursing way, the more you're going to do with yourself, you're going to do IT in a way that you're good at and you're going to stick with IT. 

发言人1   44:34
The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher. But this seems like a difficult tension to navigate because an obsessive attention to detail is a competitive advantage of your work as well. So you have these two things sort of conflicting with each other. 

发言人2   44:49
No one is going to a beat you at being you. If IT IT took, one of things like to say is like, find what feels like play to you, but looks like work to others. So IT looks like work to them, but to you feels like play. 

发言人2   45:02
It's not work. So you're going to outcompete them because you're doing IT effortless lesly. You're doing IT for fun. 

发言人2   45:08
They're doing IT for work. They're doing IT for some byproduct to you. It's art, it's beauty, it's joy, it's it's flow, it's fulfilling. Uh, you must enjoy podcasting. If you didn't, you wouldn't . 

发言人1   45:20
good at IT one hundred empires, right? 

发言人2   45:23
If if you decided that the right way to get ahead in life was to go right books, you would know what you won't heard of you. Chris Williamson's book would be a complete flop. That's not who you are. 

发言人2   45:33
You're a pod caster. You enjoy talking to people. You enjoy interviewing them. The more you do things that are natural to you, the less competition you have. You escape competition through authenticity by being your own self. 

发言人2   45:47
If I just summarized how to be successful in life, in two words, I would just say product tize yourself. And that just figure out what IT is that you naturally do, that the world might want, that you can scale up and turn into a product and it'll be it'll eventually be effortless for you. Yes, there's always work required, but he won't feel like working. 

发言人2   46:08
You, you'll feel like play to you. And modern society gives us that opportunity. You know, if you were two thousand years ago, you born a farm, your choices are very limited, right? You're gonna do stuff on that farm now. 

发言人2   46:20
You can literally wake up and you can move to a different city. You can switch careers. You can switch jobs. You can change the people that you are with, uh, you know, you can change so many things about who you are and who you are within what you're doing, that there is infinite opportunity out there for you, literally infinite. 

发言人2   46:36
And so it's much Better to treat this like a search function to find the people who need you the most, to find the work that needs you the most, to find the place your best suit to be at. And it's worthwhile to spend time in that exploitation before diving into exploiting the biggest mistake in a world with so many choices is premature commitment. If you premature to commit to being a lawyer or a doctor, and now you've got like now five years invested into that, you might have just completely missed. You might just end up in the wrong profession, in the wrong place, the wrong people for thirty years, your life granning away. And yes, the best time to figure that out was before, but the second best time is now. 

发言人1   47:12
So I just changed IT and also presumed ly kill things that aren't working very quickly. By default. 

发言人2   47:19
you should kill everything you know. If you can't decide, the answer is no, uh, and most things just be saying no to that part of my keeping my calendar free is just by default ying note everything. Do I want to create a calendar just to add your event right, or to add your need or your desire? 

发言人2   47:37
One of the other things about the early on and life, you're looking for opportunities. So you're saying yes to everything and that is a phase that you go through. That is the exploration phase. 

发言人2   47:46
Later, when you found the thing you were going to work on, you're in the exploitation phase. You have to say no to everything by default. And if you don't say, notice everything by default. If you have to even explicit go out anyway to say no to something that will take up time. 

发言人2   47:58
For example, you there there are lot of people out there were into hostile culture and and a big piece of a hostile l culture is like, well, you're not gna get something if you don't ask for IT so theyll hustle people, they'll always be sending you request messages. Yes, this is a famous person problem, but I have IT and people are always asking me for things. And I kind of square when I get these messages, and i'm sure you get these two text messages, emAiling, hey, Chris, my friend, so and socially really be on your podcasting. 

发言人2   48:23
You should come to my event. You should write a forward from my book. And you kind of square when you get this right if to figure out how to say no. 

发言人2   48:29
And one of things that I learned along the way is that if you wouldn't ask somebody else to do IT and then you get that request yourself, you can just dismiss IT. You don't have to respond. You don't even let you enter your brain. 

发言人2   48:40
You have to be delete emails and text messages without flinching. If you want to scale and scaling is very important. Scaling your time is really important. Every interruption will take you out of flow. So the only way you can remain inflow if you get either very good at ignoring these things, by default, closing yourself off like a hermit, like our mutual friend inferiors, or you just become emotionally capable of not registering these as something that causes turbulence inside of you that not . 

发言人1   49:08
registering IT emotionally thing, is that fundamental. It's so fundamental . 

发言人2   49:12
to so many things in life. okay. 

发言人1   49:14
Can we dig in to that a little bit? Is that because, again, i've only seen you as you right? I didn't know twenty years ago, I didn't know you was a child, so i've only seen you with this holistic s selfishness, the integrated self prioritization, whatever. I what we all selfish is fine. 

发言人2   49:32
I'll take selfish and selfish. I'm very selfish person. Don't contact me. 

发言人1   49:38
Yeah, did that emotional reality? I also get the sense to that maybe people have lived obligation life for so long that they actually kind of struggle to tap into what IT is that they want. They've hidden their once and their desires and their needs, and y've d prioritized themselves so much for so long. 

发言人1   49:57
So what do I want? Actually, what? What is IT want to go to this thing or not? Because all i've done is be fucking puppet red, right? I've been marianne's by other people's desires for so, so, so long I can't even tap into that anymore and saying no feels like AA war crime. 

发言人2   50:12
So so I think it's really good to be able to view your own mind and your own thoughts objectively. And that is the big benefit. Meditation IT creates a small gap between your conscious observation, self and your mind, and that lets you then look at your thoughts and evaluate them a little bit like you with a third party's statements. 

发言人2   50:33
And if you just take your mind to be you and they're integrated in one of the same at all times and you're reacting from the mind, then you're not even question things that come into your mind. Anything that comes in that create a reaction will immediate create a reaction. But if you can observe your thoughts a little bit and not in some wu way, but you can even interest do with the therapy, you can do with a journal, and you can do anyway. 

发言人2   50:53
You like can just take long walks. You don't have to meditate and do little position, and all that is unnecessary. But if you can observe your own thoughts and view them a little objectively, then you can start being, uh, a little more, choose a little more critical, and you can realize that there are no problems in the real world other than maybe things that inflict pain on your body. 

发言人2   51:14
Everything else has to become a problem in your mind. First, if you have to view IT interpreted and create narrative that IT is a problem before IT becomes a problem, and then you realize that a lot of your emotional energy is spent on reacting to things, that your mind is automatically saying our problems, uh, and you don't need all those problems. Do you really need that many problems in your life? Again, I would say try to focus on just one overarching problem and then go solve that problem. 

发言人2   51:43
Like, if you want to be successful, define successful completely. Focus on that in everything else. When IT enters your mind, that becomes a problem with the judgment about the girl walking down the street or the car that just cut in funny you or whether it's like you know this your accountant, this stupid thing like yes, it's gonna triggers you but observe for a moment that like it's triggering me, i've created a problem. 

发言人2   52:03
Do I really want to have this problem right now to only spend the energy on this problem? Or do I want that going somewhere else? And IT IT doesn't have to be that over. 

发言人2   52:11
You don't have to. The mind. Mud wrestling with itself is also a problem. 

发言人1   52:14
But not to do that, I have my problems, have got problems, and I have a real problem about fixing my problem. 

发言人2   52:20
Yeah, exactly. So just you're going to be much happier and much more focused again. I think happiness and focus and success can kind of compliment each other. 

发言人2   52:29
You're gonna have much more energy. Just think about this mental energy. You going to much more mental energy to focus on the actual problems you want to solve. 

发言人2   52:37
If you don't start unconsciously, subconsciously, reactive vely picking up problems everywhere. So before anything can be a problem that takes up your emotional energy, you have to accept IT as a problem. You can be choose about your problems. And i'm not thing i'm perfect in that regard, but I think i'm Better than I used to be. 

发言人1   52:54
A lots of people are addicted to solving problems. It's so much so that sometimes people create problems when we don't have any, simply so that we can solve them. 

发言人2   53:03
We have that going on. And then even worse, as we take on problems that we can affect. So you know, another one of my little quips, was you a rational person, a can a sort of the a rational person, you should should cultivate indifference that things that are out of their control, right? Uh, or a rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference of things that are out of their control. 

发言人2   53:29
Uh, and i'm as guilty as anybody of doom surfing on x or social media and getting worked up about things that I can do anything about, right? Like do I want to be fighting those battles in my mind when I literally cannot do anything about IT? So if you find yourself looping on a problem like you're watching the news too much and you're getting caught up in a problem you can do anything about, um you have to step away from that. 

发言人2   53:50
And uh, modern media is a delivery mechanism for memetic viruses and not what's happened now you know one hundred years ago, five hundred years ago, if something wasn't happening in your immediately facility, you want to hear about IT, IT wouldn't a problem for you. But now every single one of the world's problems has turned into a memetic virus, which is going into the battle field of the news and is trying to infect your mind in real time, so that, yes, so that you become obsessed with the warn ukraine, which is really far away. You get obsessed with climate change and you get obsessed with AI dom, or you get obsessed with and there's nothing as riveting as the old religion. 

发言人2   54:30
The world is ending. The world is ending. Pay attention, the world is ending. 

发言人1   54:33
And if you don't. 

发言人2   54:34
to send for complex global, complex global scale. And I would argue that large percentage of population are essentially just infected with these tic viruses that are taken over their brain and are causing them to do incredible generation about things that probably aren't even true or are greatly exaggerated. 

发言人2   54:49
But even to the extent they are true, there are things that person can do nothing about, and they should put their own house in order first. So, you know, another little line and half for myself is your families is broken, but you're going to fix the world, right? People are running out there to try and fix the world with my good right. And I think IT defies credibility. If you can't fix your own life first, i'm not going to take you seriously if you can't fix your own life, like all these philosophers who you know seem like people you emulate and they are smart or like these brilliant celebrities and they go off and commit suicide while you just kind of validated your whole way of life it's like that line of in no country for all men where the killers waiting for the protagonist and protection oni shows up and the killers as well you know, if your set of rules brought you here, then what good are your rules didn't work? Um IIII am holistically selfish in in that I want to be objectively successful in everything I set out to want a uh you have one life. 

发言人1   55:46
don't settle for mediocrity. Don't settle for mediocrity. 

发言人2   55:49
And and I think the only will debate intelligence, for example, right? We talk about IQ tests and all that. But I think the only true test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life, and there are two parts to that, one is getting what you want, so you know how to get IT. And the second is wanting the right things, knowing what to want in the first place. I could want to be, you know, six of eight baseball player, and i'm not going to get that. 

发言人1   56:14
So it's wanting the wrong thing. Such wanting . 

发言人2   56:17
something that you can't get . 

发言人1   56:18
is also wanting something that you don't want yeah . 

发言人2   56:21
wanting something that's a boobie prize. There are planning of boobie Prices up or two about Prices that are just not worth having or they create their own problems. 

发言人1   56:29
If you're not carefully, you can end up in a place in life not only that you don't want to be, but one that you didn't even . 

发言人2   56:36
mean to get to that if you're kind of proceeding unconsciously. And usually, I think people end up there because they are are going on autopilot with sort of society and are all the people's expectations. So uh you know all out of guilt or out of like, uh, mimic desire know Peter tile has this whole thing from the aia are about how mimetic desires are. 

发言人2   56:56
Our desires are picked up from other people. And some of those automatic bit society like, you know go to law school, go to meet school, go to whatever go to business school um or they might be from watching what your friends are doing and you know the other monkeys are doing, or you might just be what your parents expectations, or I might be a guilt. You know guilt is just society's voice speaking in your head, socially programmes. 

发言人2   57:18
So if they go low and do things that are good for the tribe, um but I think the the best outcomes come when you think IT through for yourself and decide for yourself. And I don't think people spend enough time deciding. For example, we run on these uh four years cycles. 

发言人2   57:33
You know in sick valley you go join and start up, you invest your stock over four years. That's the standard OK. Um uh in um college you know you go for four years, high school you go for four years, some things take longer. 

发言人2   57:47
You know you have children, they hit puberty nine years later has like a nine years cycle until that relationship changes. Um but we're used to these fairly long cycles, multiple cycles in which we are committed to things. You go to law school, you know, for five years cycle. 

发言人2   58:00
You go, be a lawyer, forty years cycle. These are very long cycles. The amount of time we spend deciding what to do and who to do IT with very short, very, very short, right? We spend, you know, three months deciding, one month deciding on a job where we're going to be for ten years or five years. 

发言人2   58:19
And because a lot of discoveries that dependent where the next thing you find out the path is dependent on where you were on the previous path, you sort of start going down this vector. That is a very long distance. People decide previously which city to live in, and that's going decide who their friends are with, their jobs are, their opportunity, the weather, their food supply, their air supply, quality of life. You know, it's such an important decision, but you will spend so little time thinking me through. I would argue that if you're making a four year decision, spend a year thinking IT through like really . 

发言人1   58:51
thinking IT through. Yeah exactly. There's the secretary theory. 

发言人2   58:56
Yeah the secretary theory is this computer science professor is trying to figure out a how much time you should spend interviewing secretary and then how long to keep the secretary. So that says it's gona secretary for ten years. IT keep searching for, you know, one year, two years, three years, one month, two months. 

发言人2   59:11
What is the optimal time? Uh, and IT turns out that the optimal time is somewhere around a third, about a third of the way through. You take the best person you've work with and try to find someone that good or Better. 

发言人2   59:23
So by the time you're gone about a third way through, you have extreme seen enough that you now have a sense of what the bar is. And then anybody who meet to exceeds that bar is good enough. And this applies to dating. 

发言人2   59:36
This applies to jobs and careers. This applies generally. But the interesting thing about the secretary theory is that it's actually not time based. It's not based on one third of the time. It's iteration. 

发言人1   59:46
the number of the number of . 

发言人2   59:48
shots of you to can go, that's right. So you want to have lots and lots of iteration so . 

发言人1   59:52
that you need to bail out quickly and you need to be decisive quickly, that you need to take opportunities quickly and bail out quickly . 

发言人2   01:00:00
like you go back and you look through failed relationships. Uh, probably the biggest regret will be staying in the relationship exactly. You should have left sooner. 

发言人2   01:00:09
The moment you knew wasn't onna work out, you should have moved on. So in that sense, I think malm glad will popularize this ID of ten thousand hours to mastery. I would say it's actually ten thousand iterations to mastery. 

发言人2   01:00:18
It's not actually ten thousand at some on no number, but it's about the number of iterations that drive a learning curve. And iteration is not repetition. Repetition is a different thing. 

发言人2   01:00:28
Repeating is doing the same thing or over iteration is modifying IT with the learning and then doing another version of IT. So that's a correction. So if you get ten thousand other corrections in anything, you will be an expert. 

发言人1   01:00:40
Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. You mentioned there about the people who've got a niki going on at home and are trying to fix the world. But a lot of the time that cynicism and pessimism we find in ourselves, we see the world whether we want to, whether or it's because we've been by to what the news or the negative people around us have said or it's a bit more kind of endogenous ous than that. It's just sort of in is the way that we see the world. How can people avoid sync m and pessimism within themselves? 

发言人2   01:01:08
A sync m pessimism is a tough one. IT were naturally hardwired for IT. Again, I go back evolution as i'm sorry to keep harping and evolution, but within biology, there's very few good explains for a theory of evolution by natural selection is probably the best one. 

发言人2   01:01:23
So if you can't explain something about life or psychology or human nature through evolution, that you probably don't have a good theory for IT. And I would say that pessimism is another one that comes out of this, which is in the natural environment, you're hardwired to be pessimistic because let's say that I see something rustling in the woods. And if I move towards IT and IT turns out to be food and pray, then good, I get to eat one meal. 

发言人2   01:01:44
But if IT turns to be a pretty, I get eaten and that's the end of that. So we are hardwired to avoid ruin um and and you know dying. So we are naturally hardwired to be pessimist, but modern society is very different despite whatever problems may have. 

发言人2   01:02:00
A mother society, IT is far, far safer than living in the jungle and just trying to survive. Uh, and the opportunities and the upside are nonlinear. For example, when you're investing, if you short to stock you, the most money can make us two x, you just lose, you know, the stock kle is zero. 

发言人2   01:02:16
You doubled your money. But if the stock is the next in video and IT goes one hundred x or a thousand x, you make a lot of money. So upside through because of leverage is nearly unlimited. Uh, also in modern society, because there are so many different people you can interact with, if you go on a date and to fail, they're infinite more people to going to date with. In a tribal system, there might have been twenty people, and you can even get through all of them. 

发言人2   01:02:38
So mom side is far more forgiving a failure, and you just have to save neocortical realized and override that to realize that you are much more running a search function to find the thing that will work, and then that one thing will pay off in massive compounding. Once you find your mate for the rest of your life, you find your wife for your husband, then you can compound in that relationship. It's OK. 

发言人2   01:02:59
If you had fifty failed dates in between, the same way, once you find the one business you meant apple into and will compound return is okay. If you had fifty small field ventures or fifty small failed job interviews, IT doesn't the number of failure doesn't matter. And so there's no point in being a pessimist. 

发言人2   01:03:14
You want to be an optimist, but I would say you want to be you want to be skeptical about specific things. Every specific opportunity is probably a fail, but you want to be optimistic in the general. In the general, you want to be like something in here is going to work. 

发言人1   01:03:28
How do you never get attention . 

发言人2   01:03:30
when exactly as I said, i'm optimistic in the general that if something feels right now, then this is a little wool. But IT wasn't meant to be IT was a learning experience that was an iteration as long as I learned something from IT is a win. If I didn't learn from its a loss. 

发言人2   01:03:44
But as long as you're learning and you keep iterating fast and cutting your losses quickly, then when you find the right thing, you have to be optimistic and compound into IT. So you don't want to jump into the first thing, you don't want to marry the first person you date necessarily unless you've got very lucky um but you you want to investigate and explore very, very quickly until you find the match and then you have to be willing to go all in. You have to be in the movie of chips at the table. So both those um both those approaches are required. 

发言人1   01:04:16
So it's a bobl strategy. It's sort of black or it's White and most people stuck . 

发言人2   01:04:24
in half. I pessimist, optimist, scenic, a intros extrovert. These are very self limiting. Humans are very dynamic. 

发言人2   01:04:33
There are times when you feel like being introverted, the times when you feel like being extroverted. There are contexts in which will be pessimistic. There are contexts in which will be optimistic. Leave all the labels alone. 

发言人2   01:04:43
It's Better just to look at the problem at hand, look at reality the way IT is, try to take yourself out of the equation and in a sense like obviously your involved but motivates reasoning is the worst kind of reasoning. Uh, you're not going to find truth through highly motivational reason. You have to be objective and objective means trying to take yourself out of IT as much as possible, at least your personality out of IT as as possible. 

发言人2   01:05:07
And so to the extent you run with this thick identity and personality is onna cloud, your judgment is going to try and lock you into the past. If you say i'm a depressed, unhappy person yeah, i'm going to be unhappy that's a way of walking yourself into your past, even saying, I have tram, my ptsd yeah you you feel something. There are memories, their flashes. 

发言人2   01:05:26
There are occasional bad feelings. But don't define yourself by IT because then you will lock you into your identity and disco loop on IT. It's Better to stay flexible because reality is always changing and you have to build, adapt to IT. 

发言人2   01:05:38
Adaptation is also intelligence. Adaptation is survival. Adaptation is kind of how you're here. You're here because you're adapter and your ancestors or or adapters. So to adapt, you will do see things clearly and if you're seeing them through your own identity is going to cloud your judgement. 

发言人1   01:05:53
A quick aside, you've probably heard me talk about element before. In fact, you might be thinking for take ris, will you up about element? And the answer is no, I won't. 

发言人1   01:06:02
Because when I take IT, I genuinely feel the difference. I genuinely believe that proper hydration makes a massive difference to your performance. So i'm going to keep talking about IT until you start drinking. 

发言人1   01:06:13
Element is a tasty electronic drink mix with everything that you need, nothing that you don't. Each grabble your stick park contains a signs back electorate ratio but sodium paci um and magnesium with no sugar, no coLoring, no artificial ingredients or any other junk. IT plays a critical role in reducing muscle crimes and fatigue, while optimizing brain health, regulating appetite and curbing cravings. 

发言人1   01:06:33
This orange flavor in a cold glass of water, this I have started in my morning every single day for over three years now. And I genuinely feel the difference verses when I don't. Best of all, they having no questions, ask grief when policy with an unlimited inferable. 

发言人1   01:06:46
So I can buy IT and try IT for as long as you want. And if you don't like you for any reason, they'll just give you your money back. You don't even need to return the box. 

发言人1   01:06:53
That's how confidently are that you love IT. Plus, they offer free shipping within the U. S. And right now, get a free sample pack of all eight flavors with your first box by going to the link in the description below or heading to drink LMNT dot com slash modern wisdom that drink LMNT dot com flash modern wisdom. 

发言人1   01:07:20
Moving on to so of thinking about happiness. If we see topic of yours that to. 

发言人2   01:07:25
it's honestly the one that I feel these qualified take . 

发言人1   01:07:28
about is IT like a guy that got long arms teaching how to a bench press, or do the rev. Tall teaching how to dead left someone that feels like they came from behind the eight ball yeah. 

发言人2   01:07:36
is you're asking a crazy person about their thoughts so just started through it's nothing . 

发言人1   01:07:42
is still more about peace and IT . 

发言人2   01:07:45
is about joy. This is one of the overlook words that means different things in different people, some not even sure what community in the same language. What is happiness? I think it's just basically being okay with where you are. 

发言人1   01:08:06
Not wanting not wanting things . 

发言人2   01:08:07
be different in the way they are, not having the sense that anything is missing in this moment. 

发言人1   01:08:15
needing something to change your current positive situation, being contingent on IT adjustment. 

发言人2   01:08:22
I'm getting something from the outside world. Ironically, I think most people, if you were to ask them when they were happier for a sustained period time, not for a brief moment, because pleasure can overwrite happiness and create the illusion of happiness. But if you ask people when they were happy for a sustained period time, they were probably doing some variation of nothing. 

发言人1   01:08:49
That's interesting because in the chase is this sort of black, this contingency. 

发言人2   01:08:54
that's right. But then get bored if you just sit around all the time, you get bored so you want to venture, you want surprise, like there's a funny thought experiment of the bliss machine, right? Which is suppose I could drill a hole in your head and put electrode and and they did this with monkeys, and I can put a wire in there, and I can stimulate just the right party of brain. I can put you in bliss, and you just been blessed. Would you want . 

发言人1   01:09:18
that might be . 

发言人2   01:09:19
nice for how long do IT? 

发言人1   01:09:22
I'll tell you, right? So most people will say. 

发言人2   01:09:24
well, I don't want that. I want meaning. I don't want just place. I want meaning and you like, okay, well, i'll put an electoral in there. I'll give you meeting. 

发言人2   01:09:32
How about that? And if you kind of run the start experiment long enough, I think most people realize actually what I want is I want surprise. I want in. 

发言人2   01:09:41
I want the world to surprise me. And I want to rustle with IT in ways that are somewhat predictable but somewhat not. And you kind of end up back where we started. 

发言人2   01:09:49
So II don't know if necessarily for some people, pure happiness is the ultimate goal. They want, you know, just be blissfully happy wherever they are, whatever they are. But I think other people, most people would say, well, i'm here in this world. 

发言人2   01:10:04
I'm here in this life. I don't understand IT or why, but I want to be, I want to be engaged. I want to be surprised. 

发言人2   01:10:11
I want to do things. I want accomplish things. I want to want things and then get them right. That's kind of the whole game that we're . 

发言人1   01:10:19
all playing here. Surprises are really interesting, predictably total bro science here. But i'm pretty sure that that's kind of how dopamine works, that things were a bit that are the new expected that within that, that means that if you for the perennial insecure over achiever s that Chloe for control, that really want to be able to the schedule is perfectly done. 

发言人1   01:10:40
And we know the iteration. We know where we going to be at this time. You're in some ways, I guess, reducing down the capacity for surprise because everything has become very contrived, prescribed, done in advance, laid out your ability to be surprised actually diminishes . 

发言人2   01:10:58
yeah if if nothing worked out the way you expected, if was all serendipity and you didn't want that, you would just be a blow anxiety. On the other hand, if everything worked out as you expect IT and wanted, you'd be so body, you might also be dead. So there's some, you know, the river of life kind of flows tween these two banks and enjoy IT. 

发言人1   01:11:21
You say thinking about yourself is the source of all unhappiness, but presumably you need to work on yourself and your weaknesses as well. So some degree of reflection is important. And if thinking about yourself as a source of unhappiness is the surprise that you need to pay, I need to sort reflect in wood, i'm going to have to diminish this level of happiness for a little while, and then I can use this new level. I've got my Brown belt on, and I couldn't go out into . 

发言人2   01:11:44
the world as a Brown belt. And specially ferrings to that is, if if you're thinking about your personality and your ego and the character of you and uh you're obsessing over that, that's where about a depression and happiness sort of lingers and and gets cultivated. Um so thinking about what is me this happened to me, that happened to me. 

发言人2   01:12:07
I have this personality, I have this issue. I deserve this. I didn't get that that you're just strengthening a little beast in there that is insatiable and that's where I think a lot of unhappiness comes from. 

发言人2   01:12:19
What's the beast? It's the eagle. But that were also used that I can hate to use the word um but it's it's a recurrent collection of thoughts that are very self obsessing, will never be satisfied and . 

发言人1   01:12:31
very concretizing as well. So the not malual not particular . 

发言人2   01:12:34
flex is adding to them by thinking about the all time you're creating narratives and stories and um but that's different from solving personal problems. So if you encounter something, you learn from something you're reflecting upon the learning, then you can reflect upon IT absorbing and then just move on. But sitting there are saying, i'm Chris, i'm of all I deserve this. 

发言人2   01:12:54
This happened to me, that person wrong me. This is who I am. This shouldn't have happened. I need to go get revenge on this, or I need to fix that or change this. 

发言人2   01:13:01
I mean, that I think is where a lot of mental illness is, is, you know, comes from. So IT depends if you are thinking about something to solve a problem and get IT off your chest and get IT off your mind. If IT leaves your mind clearer at the end of IT, then I think he was worthwhile. If IT leaves your mind busier at the end of IT and you're probably in the direction. 

发言人1   01:13:23
is this AA justification for detachment, cultivated ignorance, a distraction? 

发言人2   01:13:32
Ashman is not a goal of man, is a by product. It's just a by product of just realized, you know what matters and what doesn't uh and and just for one moment on the self thing, I think everybody craves thinking about something more than themselves. If you want to be you know happy to some extent, you have to forget about your personal problems. 

发言人2   01:13:53
And what would I do that is take on other problems, bigger problems, uh and that could be a mission that could be set, that could be spirituality, that could be kids um they could be Carrying about the planet. Or I think people take that a little far, you know, then they get kind of oppressive and tyrannical and support of abstract concepts. But so these seem be taken too far, just like a religion, for example. 

发言人1   01:14:14
just like anything . 

发言人2   01:14:15
in x anything in access, right? Um but generally, the less you think about yourself, the more you can think about a mission or about god or about a child or . 

发言人1   01:14:26
something like so vi hym h the found revolution said, I am reaching. I have no idea to what to do with my life and you replied, god, kids on mission pickety . 

发言人2   01:14:36
that's right preferably all three it's very liberating um yeah thinking I think over thinking about yourself is probably it's they may not be the cause of depression but I certainly doesn't . 

发言人1   01:14:53
help rumination. II kind of had a self induce stock syndrome from this sort of a thing because I like to think about stuff and you provide you with an endless number things to think about so you're kind of, yeah, you have this. You're the prisoner and the prison guard at the same time. 

发言人1   01:15:10
And I had a biga share on the show. SHE was to roll this book about at therapy, sort of pushing back against therapy. Lure for kids, specific ally for kids. There was a blast radius that covered pretty everything, including kind of cbt. I'm like like we're getting parallel ly closest really evidence based stuff here. But the more that i've thought about IT and the more that i've look at the evidence, there is like basically a direct correlation between how much you think about yourself and how miserable you are. 

发言人2   01:15:38
Therapy is great. If IT lets you event in the solves the thing and then excessed letters, you're done, you're clear. But if you're just looping on the same . 

发言人1   01:15:48
thing forever is actually the yeah yeah, how are you become happy techniques developed over . 

发言人2   01:15:57
time yeah, I used to have a lot of them. Now I kind of try not to have any because I think the techniques themselves are kind of a struggle. It's sort of like bidding for status implies your low status that reveals at your low status to someone who's basically trying to show off, uh, comes across the lost status the same way someone was trying to be happy sort of saying i'm i'm unhappy in creating that frame. So it's Better . 

发言人1   01:16:25
just not even think in terms being in lack in order to yeah. 

发言人2   01:16:28
I don't even think in terms of happiness, unhappiness anymore. I just kind of . 

发言人1   01:16:32
just do my thing again. Another question did similar to a bunch of them, do you think you could have got there had you have not done the procedural, systematic sort of step by step by step? This is what IT is. And then come out the other side. 

发言人2   01:16:44
I don't think there are any formulas. I think it's unique to each person. It's like asking a successful person, how did you become successful? 

发言人2   01:16:50
Each one of them will give you a different story. You can follow anyone else is path, and most of them are even protecting you. Some narratives version of IT that isn't quite true. 

发言人1   01:16:59
I mean, that's something that I continually realize, especially as I get to spend more time around people that are successful. I knew hear it's very important to prioritize worklife baLance, right? That's one of the most common things that people who have obtained success say. 

发言人2   01:17:13
That's not my experience. 

发言人1   01:17:14
But if you look at, you shouldn't be asking somebody who is successful what they do to continue that success. Now you should be asking them what did they do to obtain the success when they are where you were? 

发言人2   01:17:26
And the people who are really extraordinary successful didn't sit around on watching success point. They just went, did IT they? They had such an overwhelming desire to be successful at the thing that they were doing that they just went and did that thing. They didn't have time to study and learn and listen, and they just did IT. It's the overwhelmed desire that the most important and the focus that comes from that so . 

发言人1   01:17:51
tweet of yours, that was people who are good at making wealth, or people are good at attaining wealth, don't need to teach anybody else how to do with yeah. 

发言人2   01:17:59
you don't need mentors, you need action that was one of them. Now the one is the the people who actually know how to make money don't need to sell your core um yeah there's lots of variations on IT but if you don't another one, if you don't lie awake at night thinking about IT, you don't want to badly . 

发言人1   01:18:17
enough yeah I think you i've heard you talk before about how um to unclosed loops. Problems that you're working on can cause you to be sleeps and this . 

发言人2   01:18:28
i'm not a good sleeper. 

发言人1   01:18:30
Tell me about, oh. 

发言人2   01:18:31
I mean, my lee pates me so tell me I fail sleeping again. Brian Johnson thinks i'm going to die early. Probably right. 

发言人1   01:18:39
But how much you are? Can you sleep in any idea? 

发言人2   01:18:42
Ah, it's so random. Some nights asleep eight hours, some minutes asleep four hours. But it's bitter this random. 

发言人1   01:18:47
Are you bothered about that? Trying to optimize you go sleep coach teaching you . 

发言人2   01:18:52
how to I don't flog myself over things. If I want to sleep, sleep, I don't want to sleep, I don't sleep. It's not AI don't think i'm doing . 

发言人1   01:19:00
anything right. Don't believe good night. 

发言人2   01:19:03
bad night. Now I work out every day because I think that gives me more energy. And i've gotten into good habit with IT. 

发言人2   01:19:09
Maybe we'll do the same thing with sleep. Maybe i'll develop a good habit, but i'm gonna beat my self up over IT. They'll come a point where is important to me. 

发言人2   01:19:15
When it's important to me, I just do IT. You know, most of you, for example, you get people with addictions right over reading or smoking or whatever. They can kind of go through all the different methods, but it's have hearted. 

发言人2   01:19:27
And then one day they like, oh, shit. I've got lunch after my dad at lunch when they dropped immediately. So I think a lot of a lot of change is more about desire and understanding than IT is about a forcing yourself or try to domesticate yourself. 

发言人1   01:19:42
It's efficiency. I guess you know a lining. The thing that you want to do with the way that you feel . 

发言人2   01:19:48
about what IT is that you want to do? Yeah, it's not it's not getting caught up in a in a half desire or memetic desire. It's really just being aware of what IT is that you actually want at this point in time. 

发言人2   01:20:02
And when you want something, then you will act on IT with maximum capability, and that's the time to act on IT. The meantime, just doing IT because other people tell you should do IT, or society tells you should do IT, or you feel slightly guilty about IT. These are, these are ha hearted efforts and have have hearted efforts don't get there. 

发言人1   01:20:19
As you get older, one thing that becomes harder to ignore is your tester n levels, the impact, everything from your energy to your mood and however you recover. However, there are signs spect supplements like tonka that support tesone strength and recovery. And that is why i'm such a huge fan of more this product because they make the only NSF certified tonk cat ali, on the planet. 

发言人1   01:20:41
That means it's so rigorously tested, but that even olympic athletes can use IT. And why I partner with them, because they make the most carefully tested, highest quality supplements on earth. This is a huge part of my brain, body and sleeps stack, which makes a big impact of my cognition, I strength and my recovery.

发言人1   01:21:29
This is one of you was an anxiety, is the emotion to share of the twenty first century, and a lots of driven people, very anxious, very paranoid, that's what's caused them to be affected, that pay so much attention, detail oriented, not letting things go to, staying up at night, thinking about IT. That's the paranoia. What have you come to learn about anxiety and dealing with that? 

发言人2   01:21:49
So anxiety and stress are interesting. They're very related. Stress is when, if you look at an iron beam, when iron beam is under stress is because it's being bent in two different directions at the same time. So when your mind is under stress is because IT has two conflicting desires at once. 

发言人2   01:22:06
So for example, you know you you want to be liked, but you want to do something selfish, and you can't reconcile IT to and so you are under stress um you want to do something for somebody else. You want to do something for yourself, right? These are exact. You you don't want to go to work, but you want to make money so you're understand, right? So you have two conflicting desires, and I think one of the ways to get through stress is to acknowledge that, oh, I actually have two conflicting desires. 

发言人2   01:22:30
And either I need to resolve IT, I need to pick one and then be OK losing the other, or I will decide later, but at least just being aware of why your stress can help alleviate a lot of stress in an anxiety, I think, is sort of this pervasive and identifiable stress where you just kind of stressed out all the time, you're not even sure why, and you can even identify the underlying problem. And the reason for that is because you, you have so many unresolved problems, unresolved stress points that have piled up in your life that you can no longer identify what the problems are. There is a mountain of garbage in your mind and a little bit of IT poking out the top like an iceberg. 

发言人2   01:23:10
And that's anxiety. But underneath there's a lot of unresolved things. And so you just need to kind of go through very carefully every time you're anxious. 

发言人2   01:23:18
Like, okay, why my animals this time? I don't know why. Oh, well, let me sit here and just think about, let me let me be write down what the possible causes could be. 

发言人2   01:23:26
Let me meditate on IT. Let me journal. Let me talk to a therapy. Me talk to my friends. Let me just can see, like when does that stress go away, if you can can identify and unravel and resolve these issues that I think that helps get rid of anxiety. 

发言人2   01:23:40
A lot of the anxieties piled up because we move through life too quickly, not observing our own reactions to things, we don't resolve them. So this goes counter to, I was saying earlier about not reflecting too much on things, but you reflect on the problems to observe them and solve them. You don't reflect on them to . 

发言人1   01:23:55
feel Better about. Well. 

发言人2   01:23:56
if if you're doing IT to just feel Better about yourself, that could be strengthening your personality in your ego and could be creating a more fragile personality. You know, one, one big anxiety result for me is the room living on death. I think that's a good one. 

发言人2   01:24:12
You're onna die. It's all going to zero. You cannot take anything with you. And I know this is trit, and I know we don't spend enough time thinking about the big questions we can give up on them. We were very, very Young. 

发言人2   01:24:23
You know, a little child might ask the big questions, like, why are we here? Was the making a life? What is all about you is sena laws, our god. 

发言人2   01:24:30
But then as adults, we're taught not to think about these things. We were given up on them. But I think the big questions are a big questions for good reasons. And uh, if you can keep the idea in front of you at all times that you're going to die and that everything goes literally to zero was IT distress about yeah . 

发言人1   01:24:50
for beta was life is very short. How should people deal with its brief ness? 

发言人2   01:24:56
Enjoy IT make the best you know it's even brief er than that each moment just disappears. It's gone. There's only a present moment and it's gone instantly. So if you're not if you're not there for IT, if you're stressed out or you're anxious or you're thinking about something else, you missed IT. So you're any moment when you're not in that moment, you are dead. 

发言人2   01:25:18
To that moment you might as well be dead because your mind is off doing something else, or you living in some, imagine reality that is just a very poor substitute for the actual reality. So one of my recent realization was, what is wasted time? What is what is a waste of time? So I don't like to wasted, but what is wasted time? And everything is wasting time in a sense, because nothing matters in the ultimate, but in each moment the thing matters. 

发言人2   01:25:48
In each moment the the only thing that matters actually that what's happening in funny you is literally has all the meaning in the world. And so what matters is just being present for the thing. So if you're doing something that you want to do and you're fully therefore IT, there's not waste the time if you don't want to do IT and your mind is run away from IT and you're reacting against IT and you're wishing you were somewhere else and you're thinking about some other thing or you're anticipating some future thing or regretting some past thing or being fearful of something, then that's wasted time. 

发言人2   01:26:19
That's time that's being wasted when you're not actually present for the reality in front of you. So my definition, wasted time. Yes, I do want some material things in life, and I know there are things that have more value than others within this life, but this life is very short and bounded. So the true waste, the time of the time that you are not present for, when you are not there for you, when you are not doing the thing you want to do to the best of the cable, is such that you're immersed. If you're not immersed in this moment, then you're wasting your time. 

发言人1   01:26:48
People get worried about dying and no longer being here, but they don't realize that so much of their life is spent not being here. In any case, that's right. 

发言人2   01:26:55
But anything people creve being here for IT. And when you're here for IT, you're actually not thinking about yourself. You are more immersed in the thing that the moment the task at hand. 

发言人1   01:27:07
we don't want piece of mind. We want piece for our mind. That's right. 

发言人2   01:27:10
Yeah you know, peace. The mind is what killed each to ally if you let IT and there's more to you than the mind how so. Well, I am very, if I don't want to dissemble the body, so speaking, right, please go. Yeah at the end the day, like everything arises within your consciousness. 

发言人1   01:27:32
right? 

发言人2   01:27:32
There were also to consciousness relative static in the sense of the the same for the moment you were born, to the moment you die. And everything that you experiencing your body, from your mind, to the world, to to everything, is within that consciousness. a. 

发言人2   01:27:48
And that thing, that base layer of being in this is what the buddh will tell you, is the real thing. Everything that comes and goes in the middle, including your mind, including your bodies, unreal. And trying to find stability in those transient things, is your castle, is your building on sand that's going to crumble. 

发言人1   01:28:07
Life is going to play out the way it's going to play out. There will be some good and some bad. Most of IT is actually just up to your interpretation. 

发言人1   01:28:14
You're born, you have a set of sensory experiences, and then you die. How you choose to interpret those experiences is up to you. Different people interpret them in different ways. 

发言人2   01:28:22
Yeah I see all line about two people walking on the street that are having the exact same experience. One is experiences. One is happy, one is sad, right? It's a narrative in their heads is how they choose to interpret um so I think when I said that there was a long time ago, I was talking more about having positive interpretations and negative interpretation. But these days, I think is Better than not to have any . 

发言人1   01:28:42
interpretations and to just allow things . 

发言人2   01:28:44
to be you're still gonna have interpretations. You can stop IT and or should you try but even that having an interpretation is just the thing you could leave alone yeah. 

发言人1   01:28:55
I really want to try just digging a little more to the best way to remind people that they should value that time. Just how brief IT is that? The time that you spend ruminating, being distracted, fears of the past regrets. 

发言人2   01:29:16
I don't anna, tell him I had to live life. I would just say that to the extent that you want to improve your quality life, the a the easiest and based way to do that is to observe your own mind and your own thoughts and and be a little not not as a critical but um be observing of yourself more objectively and then you kind of realize your own loops and patterns that takes time. It's it's not overnight. 

发言人1   01:29:41
It's not a antanas ous go is not a one time event . 

发言人2   01:29:44
yeah and there's letting go is not necessarily even the right answer like yes, if you're trying to be in enlighten being and you know you will live like a god and everything be perfect, be a budda sure you can let go. But I think in practice actually quite hard to do. 

发言人2   01:29:57
Um I think I would say that it's uh you GTA find a lot of fulfillment out of life by just doing what you want to do and genuinely expLoring what IT is that you want rather than doing what other people expect you do or society expects you to do, or what you might just think that should be done by default. You know, I think most older, successful people will tell you that their life was best when they lived IT unapologetically on their own terms. Fish . 

发言人1   01:30:29
selfish clip . 

发言人2   01:30:32
to fish bad. 

发言人1   01:30:34
I had this inside. I question, I guess, how much do you think that we should trust the voice in our heads? Because half of wisdom suggest to rely on your sort of bottom up intuition, and then half of IT has to be sort of top down rational as possible. How do you navigate detention between head and gut in this way? 

发言人2   01:30:56
I think the gut is what decides the head is, kind of what rationalized afterwards. The gut is the ultimate sion maker, if he doesn't. And what is the gut? The gut is refined judgment. Its taste. 

发言人1   01:31:08
aggregate to . 

发言人2   01:31:09
aggregated and IT could be agreed through evolution, uh, and send your genes in your DNA or I could be aggregated through your experiences and what you thought through the mind is good at solving new problems and uh new problems in the external world that have defined edges, you know, beginnings and ends and and objectives. What the mind is actually really bad at is making hard decisions. 

发言人2   01:31:33
So when you have a hard decision to make, I find its Better to, yes, you ruminate on IT. You think through all the present coins, but then you sleep on IT. You wait a couple of days, you wait until the gut answer appears with conviction and IT feels right. And when you're Younger, IT takes longer because you just don't have as much experience. And when you're older um you can happen much faster. 

发言人1   01:31:53
which is why you have time to yeah all people . 

发言人2   01:31:55
are more setting their way as a consequence, right they know what they want. They know what they don't want. And so IT takes time to develop your got instinct and judgment but once you've developed them, don't trust anything else because you can't go against your god, it'll bite you in the end. 

发言人2   01:32:09
Usually in relationships that failed, you can look back and say, oh, actually, I know it's gna fail because of this reason, but I kind of went ahead anyway because I wanted IT to be this way, right? I wanted this person to be a different way they are. I wanted to get a different thing out of IT. 

发言人2   01:32:23
Then I thought I was going, then I knew I was going to get, but I just wanted that. So sometimes desire will override your judgment and then trap you. Ah I wish for thinking IT traps you into a into a pathway that chose choose up time. 

发言人1   01:32:36
What's that uh, inside of yours? Um we think we can change ourselves, but we can we think we can change all the people, but we can't . 

发言人2   01:32:43
exactly things to add to that. You can change other people, you can change your reaction to them, you can change yourself. But other people only change through trauma or their own insight on their own schedule, and never in a way that you like. 

发言人1   01:32:56
Yeah, a land button says that people do sometimes to change, but rally in relationships and never when they told to absolutely . 

发言人2   01:33:03
yeah the fastest way to kind of alienate somebody please to tell them to change in fact ah the deal carnegy school of public speaking, you know the way that Operates is uh, they get you up there and they realized that the number one problem with public speaking is, uh that uh, people are very self conscious and so, uh, people who are practicing in the deal, county police being, I don't know, I never went to what I heard the second hands. 

发言人2   01:33:27
I could be wrong, but I like story where they get up and they start speaking. And the people, the audience, are only a lot to compliment them, genuine compliments, not fake compliments, on things that they did well. But you're not like to criticize them on things that they did poorly. 

发言人2   01:33:40
And eventually they kind of get through IT and they developed self confidence the same way. Uh, there's like the Michelle Thomas school of language learning. And on that one, what they do is you you listen to a teacher talking to a student, they're not teaching you. You're not expected to a remember, remember as anything users listen to a students stumbling over the language, it's a Better way to learn because yourself don't feel flow. You're being tested graded current. 

发言人1   01:34:03
not in your own head. 

发言人2   01:34:04
You're you even be laughing at the student and you might be agreeing with a teacher or vice versa, sympathising with the student. But because you are a pass sive observer and more objective about IT, you aren't threat and fearful and you can learn Better. And coming back to the original point of you can change people if you do want to change someone's behavior. 

发言人2   01:34:24
II think the only effective way to do IT is to compliment them when they do something you want not to positive yeah exactly not to insult them will be negative or critical when they do something you don't want. And we can help IT. It's obviously in our nature to criticize. 

发言人2   01:34:38
And I do IT as well, but I just reminds me that like when somebody does something praise worthey don't forget to praise them like definitely go out with and it'll be genuine IT has to be genuinely can be a fake thing. Uh this is not you know one of those uh, just drop in compliments type thing eventually that people will see through that they want authenticity. But just don't forget to praise people when they do something praise worthy and you will get more that behavior. 

发言人1   01:35:00
There was AA really be famous thread on redit about five questions to ask yourself if you are uncertain about your relationship. One of the questions was, are you truly in love with the arena, or just that potential or the idea of them and that the know they shows such great promise? Look at their ability for for, for changing growth. They they they're on the right path. The partner . 

发言人2   01:35:21
matching thing is so hard, you know, when people come in to asked me like, oh, I be with this person like well, if you are asking me, just clearly no, right? Because you wouldn't have to ask if you were with the right person or when you ask someone like why they are uh, in a relationship with somebody to start reading out his her resume. It's also a bad side. 

发言人1   01:35:40
What do you mean? Oh. 

发言人2   01:35:42
like, oh, we have so much in common. We like to golf together, not a basis for relationship or oh, you know she's a ballerina or you know he went to harvard or what have you this is the resume item. So that's not the person. 

发言人2   01:35:55
actually. I just love being with this person. I just trust them. 

发言人2   01:35:59
I know II enjoy being around them. I, I, I, I love how capable he is. I love how kind he is. 

发言人2   01:36:06
You know, I love her spirit. I love his energy. Uh, the more the more materially and concretely definable the reasons. Are you together? The worst they are. 

发言人1   01:36:16
the ineffable is actually where the the sort of true love lies because . 

发言人2   01:36:20
real love is a form of unity. It's a form of connection, is connecting spirits oh, youtube, my consciousness meets your consciousness. It's the underlined drive. 

发言人2   01:36:31
Uh in love, in art, in uh science, in uh mister ism is the desire for unity, is a desire for connection. As you know, bar has famously wrote, in every human there is a sense of something infinite has been lost. You know, there's a god shape hole in you, you trying to fail. 

发言人2   01:36:49
And so we're always trying to find that connection. Love is trying to find IT in one other person and saying, okay, you may, I am the ml, whatever, know what your part elections are now we connect. Now we form MA whole, a uh uh connected whole. Or in mister ism. 

发言人2   01:37:05
It's like it's all about OK sit down, meditate and you'll feel the whole in science it's like, oh uh no, Adams bouncing is mechanics, but that generates heat so thermal dynamics in motion or canadian s or one combine theory that's a whole electricity and manages m or one thing that's that's whole create a sense of all uh, in art it's like I feel an emotion. I create a piece of art around IT and then you see that painting or you see the sit in chapel or read s the poem and you feel that emotion so again, it's it's creating unity, it's creating connection. Uh, and I think everybody craves that. And so when you really love somebody is because you you feel a sense of holness by being around them啊。And that sense of holness probably doesn't have anything to do with what school they went to, you know or what career . 

发言人1   01:37:54
there just sort of tying that into the life is short. Stop fucking about. If you're face with a difficult choice, you cannot decide. 

发言人1   01:38:01
The answer is no. And the reason is modern societies full of options. Knowing this rationally sounds sounds great, but having the courage to commit to IT in reality, I think, is a different task. And cutting your loss is quickly in the big three relationships, jobs and locations is hard. What would you say to someone who may cerebrally be able . 

发言人2   01:38:29
to agree with you and say, he said, he said what I really, he says, what I really notice about you is your ability to walk away from situations that are just not good enough for you or not good enough for you. yes. And I think that is a characteristic that I have. 

发言人2   01:38:46
Well, I will not accept second best outcomes in my life and ultimately you will end up wherever is acceptable to you. You will get out of life whatever is acceptable to you um and there are certain things to me that are very, very important where I will not settle for second best. But then there are a lot of other things I just don't care about. 

发言人2   01:39:07
Because if I spend all my time caring about those things, I don't have the energy for the few things that matter. And uh so in decision making up a few horst CS for myself, other people can use their own, but minor, if you can't decide, the answer is no. If you are often an opportunity, if you have a new thing that you are saying yes or no to, that is a change from where you starting the answers by default, always know. Secondly, uh, if you have two decisions, if you have a or b, and both seem like very equal, take the path that's more painful in a shorter, the one that's gona be painful immediately, because your brain is always trying to avoid pain. So any pain that is imminent, IT is going to treat as much larger than IT actually is. 

发言人1   01:39:52
This is kind of like a decision make equivalent of talib surgeon. 

发言人2   01:39:56
Uh, tell a surgeon where the you want, the surgeon doesn't look as good because he's more likely to be good surgeon. Yeah, similar in that appearances are deceiving because you're avoiding conflict, are avoiding pain. So take the path is a more painful in the short term, because your brain screen is illusion. The short term pain is greater in the long term pain, because long term can you ourself . 

发言人1   01:40:16
all kinds . 

发言人2   01:40:17
of m actly. So take the more short term painted one. And then finally, the last one, which I would credit couple gup to with, uh, is that you want to check and take the choice that will leave you more economists in the long term. 

发言人2   01:40:30
Economists, I means like more peace, more mental piece in the long term. So whatever clears your mind more and will have you having less self talk in the future, if you can model that out, that is probably the Better right to go. And that I would focus decision making down on the three things that really matter, because I really else is downstream of these these three decision, especially these are early life decisions. 

发言人2   01:40:51
Later in life are different things to optimize for. But early in life, you're trying to figure out who you're with, what you're doing and where you live. And I think in all three, those you want to think you want to think pretty hard about IT. 

发言人2   01:41:04
And people do some of these unconsciously, you know who you're with. Its very often cycle. We in a relationship with stumble along is felt, okay, been enough time, so we ve got married, right? Not great reasons. Maybe a terrible reasons either means people who over think these things sometimes don't get the right answer. 

发言人2   01:41:20
But maybe here, if you are the kind of person that's not going to settle for second best, you iterate you iterate on a close time frame so they don't run up the clock and then you decide um on what you do. You try a whole bunch of different things until you find the one that feels like play to you, looks like work to others. Can't lose at IT um get some leverage, try to find some practical application of IT and go into that and then where you live, uh, where you live is really important. 

发言人2   01:41:44
I don't think people spend enough time on that one. I think people pick cities randomly based on where I went to school or where my family happened to be or where my friend was or I visited one weekend. I really liked you, really wanted think IT true because where you live really strains and defines your opportunities. 

发言人2   01:42:01
Um IT uh, it's going to determine your friends circle, it's going to determine your dating pool. It's going determine your job opportunities, is going to determine the food and air and water quality that you receive. Um it's going to determine your proximately to your family, which might be important as you get older and have kids. 

发言人2   01:42:18
So very, very, very important decision whether you know what your life, how much you stay inside or outside, how long you'll live based on that. And I think people choose that one probably more poorly than they. They put a lot of this thought into that one than the other two in some ways. 

发言人1   01:42:31
yeah. But also the, you're so right. How many people fall backward into a relationship and before they know IT living together, we were kids because . 

发言人2   01:42:41
then that's half of you and half of running around. You're never going to separate yourself from that. So once you have a child with somebody, then the most important thing in the world to use half that other person. 

发言人1   01:42:52
whether you like them or not. Jeffrey Miller had a tweet a long time ago that I always think about. He said, every parenting book in the world could be replaced with one book on behavioral genetics. I am a big believer in genetics. 

发言人2   01:43:07
Yes, I do think a lot of behavioral downstream of genetics and I think we underplay that we like to overplay nurture and underplay nature for AI underplay nature for societal reasons but nature is a big deal um the temperament of the person you marry . 

发言人1   01:43:23
is probably going to reflected in your child default well. 

发言人2   01:43:27
the secret to a happy relationship is too happy people, right? So I would say if you want to be happy, then, uh, be with a happy person. Don't think you be with someone who's unhappy and then make them happy down the road if you're okay with them being unhappy. But there are other things you like about them that's fine. 

发言人1   01:43:43
But this goes back to happiness with other things. 

发言人2   01:43:46
And actually we talk a little bit about how people do connect successfully, you know, on spirit and those things, but that me a little too abstract. If you want to go get a little more practical, IT could be based on values. And values are set of things you won't compromise on. 

发言人2   01:44:01
Values are the tough decisions of, oh, my parent got sick. Do they moving with us, or do we put them in in a nursing home? Uh, you know, the people, do we give the children money or do we not? 

发言人2   01:44:11
Uh, you know, do we um do we move across the country to be closer to our family, or do we stay put where we are? Uh, you know, do we argue about politics to be care, or do we not? right? The values are way more important then checklist items. Uh, and H, I think if people were to align much more on their values, they would have much more successful relationships. 嗯。

发言人1   01:44:34
the emotional pain of a fearing change. I have distinct to job, the location partner i'm going to enter or not enter this thing for the most party of leaving. I think we have this sort of love. 

发言人2   01:44:47
this version, just painful. Separating yourself in front your friends is embarrassin. 

发言人1   01:44:52
And would you advise people to get past themselves with the loss aversion, the year of change? 

发言人2   01:44:57
Good is the hardest thing in the world. Uh, starting over. It's back to the zero one thing. 

发言人2   01:45:02
It's, uh it's the mountain climbing thing. You're not gona find your pat to the top of the mountain in the first go around. Sometimes you go up there, you get stuck and you come back down, and the difference win. All the successful people in the ones not is the ones who are successful wanted so badly. They want to go back and start over again, again, whether in their career or in their relationships or anything else. 

发言人1   01:45:22
The most seriously you take yourself, the unhappier you're going to be. You learn how to take yourself less seriously. 

发言人2   01:45:29
What fame doesn't help on that one, because that is one of the traps of fame. People always talking about you. They have a certain view of you and you start believing that and then you take yourself seriously and then that limits your own actions. 

发言人2   01:45:41
You can't look like a fool anymore. Um you can do new things anymore you know tomorrow and announce some a break answer right? That's gonna met with a lot of score . 

发言人1   01:45:51
and ridiculous back to. 

发言人2   01:45:53
yeah the truth is if I want to be breakdancing, I would be great dancing but uh, you know that i'm starting a new company zero to one again from scratch. Let's do IT you know one more time uh, and not just going in raising a big VC find or retiring or what have you. But that's because I want to build the product. 

发言人2   01:46:08
I want to see IT exist. So I think that you constantly just have to force yourself you to remind yourself, um look, deep down, you're still the same, Chris or when you were nine years old, deep down you're still a kid um you know you still curious about the world. You still have a lot of the same product, elections and desires. 

发言人2   01:46:25
And once you're got a nice thing on IT, but one of the nice things when you have kids as you realized how much closer they are to you in personality and knowledge and know how like I look at my son who's a you know is eight and ah I just noticed like wow he probably has sixty to eighty percent of my knowledge and development with done is a lot more freedom and he is a lot more spontaneous way. He's smarter and there's not a big gap. You're left to close this kids gonna. 

发言人2   01:46:55
You know, done very soon. I caught up to me. And so to the extent that I think I know Better, or that i'm somewhere, or that i'm someone, is, is just an illusion, is, is just a belief. 

发言人1   01:47:06
What's the lining aged between that and taking yourself too seriously? 

发言人2   01:47:10
I shouldn't take myself too serious. Ly, because there isn't nothing here to take that seriously. And if I take myself too seriously, then i'm going to get trapped. I'm gonna get, i'm going to circumscribe myself again into a limited set of behaviors and outcomes that keep me from being free, keep me from being spontaneous, keep me from being happy. So IT just goes back to that, you know, don't think about yourself too much. 

发言人1   01:47:32
There's a special type of pain in realizing that the advice that you need to hear is right now is something that almost always you learned a long time ago and that you know, you basically sort of the same person you were as you are nine. You know, a lot of the time people ask questions like what advice you wish you would give me a self, ten years ago, people ask themselves that question. Almost invariably the advice that you would give yourself ten years ago is still the advice you need to hear today. 

发言人2   01:47:59
absolutely. That's why I did that exercise of thinking back, you know, ten years, twenty years, thirty years ago. What advice, what I give myself for me is just be less emotional. Don't take don't take everything so seriously, do the same things, but do them without all the emotional turbulence. And so that's the advice on giving myself going forward. 

发言人1   01:48:18
Yeah, yeah. It's funny how we need that distance to be able to be a little bit more objective, to have a little bit more perspective. And it's almost a little bit of a trick, right? Because typically when you do that, you say, what would you tell a friend that was going through this, right? And then you try to turn the advice to the friend around onto yourself. But you always think i'm not the friend. You know, you ten years ago, there's enough distance in that you I actually am still that person. 

发言人2   01:48:43
There's just a single line between. And related, this story is, I think understanding is way more important than discipline. Now jawa would have a fit. 

发言人2   01:48:52
But you know, on physical things, discipline is important. If I want to build a good body, I got to work out on a regular basis. But on mental things, I think understanding is way more important. Once you see the truth of something you cannot undo IT. All of us have a had experiences where we've seen a behavior in a person and then I just changes what we think about that person. We no longer want to be friends with them or we deeply respect them if I was you know really good behavior that maybe was observed unintentionally um so when we when we really do see something clearly IT changes our behavior immediately and that is far more efficient than trying to . 

发言人1   01:49:32
change your behavior . 

发言人2   01:49:34
through reputation in example um if you were, let's say that you know you have a friend and that person turns out to be a thigh, you see that person steals something, you're done with them uh if you are, uh you know the smoking lung cancer example is a good one, right? 

发言人2   01:49:51
Someone close to you or anytime someone close to you dies or you even hear about someone dying, you hear about someone like, what's the first thing you do the first thing, assuming that you wearing obviously different, but if you weren't that close to them, but you know, you hear about someone in your extended such are dying, you immediate start trying different, distinguish yourself from them like all, how was this person? You know, did they have where the smoker, you know, did they have an issue? Do I have that issue? right? 

发言人2   01:50:14
You media start comparing and what what what you're doing there is your sort of just trying to see if there is an overlap here. But if you see the truth in something, if if you like, oh my god, this person was the same age as me, and they died. And that started to happen in my age where I started to hear extend circle. People just reminds you, time is really short. There's a truth that . 

发言人1   01:50:36
there's . 

发言人2   01:50:36
a truth that there that you can actually just can see a for example, I think you into body building or something back . 

发言人1   01:50:45
when I like very lifting stuff yeah right. But there . 

发言人2   01:50:49
probably was a point where you were a being really ago in the gym and you injured yourself many times. 

发言人1   01:50:57
right? 

发言人2   01:50:57
And one of those was a deep understanding of uncle beyond this point. But there was a truth there. So again, when you when you see these things in such a way that you can't unc them, that changes your behavior instantly. And I would argue that that introspections to find those truth is actually very useful. 

发言人1   01:51:16
Is that a justification for more experimental exploration experience in life? So of trying to find serendipity, because all of these experiences are going to teach you a in escape of lesson. 

发言人2   01:51:29
You're going to do what you're going to do come on your level of exploration, I think is sort of up to you but life is always throwing truth back at you ah it's about whether you choose to see IT, whether you choose acknowledge IT uh, even if it's painful. Truth is often painful, right? If IT wasn't, we'd all be seeing truth all the time. Reality is always reflecting truth. 

发言人1   01:51:49
That's all IT. 

发言人2   01:51:50
Why exactly? Uh you know all the all the philosophy that out there, for example, uh, it's almost trait like most people, they look at philosopher, like until they discovered for themselves because wisdom is the set of things that that cannot be transmitted. If they could be transmitted if we'd read the same five philosopher book and would all be done, we'd all be wise. 

发言人2   01:52:11
You have to learn IT for yourself. IT has to be rediscovered for yourself in your own context. You have to have specific experience. 

发言人2   01:52:17
Is that then allow you to generalize and see the truth in those things in such a way that you're not going to and see them, but each person is going to see them in a different way? I can tell you that socky story, and it's not onna resonate until there's something that other people desire that you realize you yourself don't want. And the moment that happens, then you'll see the truth in the general statement. 

发言人1   01:52:38
I wanna just read you a two minute essay that I wrote AA couple of weeks ago called unteach able lessons. I've been thinking about the special category of lesson one would you cannot discover without experiencing? At first hand, there is a certain subset of advice that for some reason, we all refuse to learn through instruction. 

发言人1   01:52:55
These are unteach able lessons, no matter how arduous are costly or repeating lily is going to be for us to find out ourselves. We preferred to disregard the mountains of warnings from old's songs, literature, historical catastrophes, public scandals, and instead think some version of, yeah, that might be true for them, but not for me. We decide to learn the hard lessons, the hard way, over and over again. 

发言人1   01:53:17
Unfortunately, they all seem to be the big things, too, to never knew insights about how to put up level shelves or charming to introduced yourself at the cocktail party. Instead, we spend most of our lives learning, first hand, the most important lessons that the previous generations already warned us about, things like money won't make you happy. Fame one to fix yourself worth you don't love that pretty girl, she's just hot and difficult to get nothing as important as you think IT is when you're thinking about IT, you will regret working too much. 

发言人1   01:53:46
Worrying is not improving your performance. All your fears are a waste of time. You should see your parents more. 

发言人1   01:53:51
You'll be fine after the break up and be grateful that you did IT. It's perfectly okay to cut toxic people out of your life. And even reading this less back, i'm rolling my eyes that how fucking tried IT is. These are all basic bitch obvious insights that everybody has heard before. 

发言人1   01:54:08
But if they are so basic, why does everyone so reliably fall pray to them throughout our lives? And if they are so obvious, why do people who have recently become famous or wealthy or last of parent are gone through a breakup start to proclaim these facts with the renewed grandier ceremony of someone who's just gone through religious revelation? It's also a very contentious list of points to say on the internet. 

发言人1   01:54:29
If you interview a billionaire says that all of his money didn't make him happy, or a movie star who said that her film felt like a prison, the internet will tear them apart for being ungrateful, out of touch. So not only do we refuse to learn these lessons, we even refuse to hear the message from those warning us about them. And even more than that, I think for every one of these, if I consider a bit deeper, I can recall the time, including right now, well, I convince ed myself that I am the exception to the rule, that my particular mental makeup, or life situation or historical wounds, dreams for the future, render me immune to these lessons being applicable. 

发言人1   01:55:04
No, no, no. My in a landscape would be solved by skirting around the most well known wisdom of the ages. No, no, no. I can thread this needle properly, watch me done through the minefield, and avoid all of the trip wise that everyone else kicks. And then you kick one and you share a knowing luck, the kind that can only occur between two people who have been hurt in the exact same way. And a voice in the back of your mind will say, I told you so that is a good, I say. 

发言人2   01:55:32
I think one of the reasons why these lessons are unteach able as because, uh, they're too broad. They have to be applied in context. A number of the ones that you let out contradict each other, like spend more time with your parents and you, I don't work so hard, but you know, the same time you do want to be successful, right? I think I think a lot of these lessons come from down on high from, as you said, like the famous movie star or the billionaire ying oh, you don't need me to be happy. It's like, well, give IT up pitch right? 

发言人2   01:56:01
Um so in reality, I think many of these contracts each other and it's if you went to school and use a study philosophy four years, he would not even know how to live life because you would know which philosophical doctoring to apply circumstance uh you have to actually live life, go through all of the issues to figure out what that is that you want. What's the context in which some of these things apply and some of them don't um yes, you want to visit your parents more often, but you don't live with your parents and you don't want to necessarily see them every day or every weekend depending on the parents you might like along with one of them. So I think IT is highly contextual. Um that said, II would argue that once you figured out yourself, you can kind of carve these variations on these maxims that apply to you and uh then you'll have a specific experience that helps you remember IT and actually execute on IT and you can also phrase IT in a way where's not tried anymore so like my yeah so so a lot of my maxims in those to are carved in a way that they're modernized. They're saying something true, which might be tried if I didn't say in a new way or an interesting way that is more relevant to me today. 

发言人1   01:57:09
There is AA nobel prize winner who said something to the effect of. Everything worth saying may have been said before, but given that nobody was listening, IT must be said again. 

发言人2   01:57:18
Yeah, he has been said again, has to be reconstructed. As for the modern age, things do change technology than cultural changes. 

发言人1   01:57:24
People change on that. I've heard you say, um you talk about the difference between seeming wise and being wise that um you tried to appear a smart as a kid by sort of studio wrote memorization mascara is insight and wisdom certain ly feel that know a lot of the show for me I think has been wasn't still as a redemption arc from this a decade of my life I completely suppressed any intellectual curiosity and like OK will be professional party boy for ten years stand on the front door of a nigh club and give up VIP responds and have access to all of the pretty girls . 

发言人2   01:58:02
or know the cool parties . 

发言人1   01:58:04
or whatever IT might be. 

发言人2   01:58:06
They worked okay for . 

发言人1   01:58:07
a what luck IT was a good way to spend my twenties, but come back above, put your head above water, two degrees, one of which was a masters and then they, like, just shut down any of that learn. I mean, did that why I was a uni, why I was a uni, was running the events? So he's actually a decade and a half, and I think there was a big redemption arc within this, the show. And II constantly have to kind of wipe the slime of me of this sense that I need to prove myself. And so much of IT this White really resonates with me when you're memorising things that indicates you don't understand them or that sort of wrote memorization and reggina masking is wisdom because people use fluency as a proxy for truthful ness and insight that use the complexity of your language in your communication. 

发言人2   01:58:54
Yes, a lot of out there. I think it's it's the mark of a charleton to explain a simple thing in a complex way. And so when you see people using very complicated language to explain simple things, they are either trying to impress you in office, kid, or they don't understand themselves. 

发言人1   01:59:10
INA lure in that, though, know, this was one of the things I had to do when I went to therapy. Kind of interesting and i've talked about this before um I needed to turn off podcast, Chris, when I stepped in to therapy because most of the time that I spend one on one in a deep conversation that's undistracted throughout the week, i'd trained myself over when I started doing at seven hundred episodes now nine hundred and whatever and II knew what I could do to say to this therapy some you know to just sort fear off a little and create some nice story. Put a ball on IT pushed across the table and watch your eyes light up a little bit like a little grain or a self applying joke. Like you're not here, you your performing, you're doing this, you doing the Chris Wilson s something with . 

发言人2   01:59:54
the sort of jahn . 

发言人1   01:59:55
at my own version. 

发言人2   01:59:57
Tell me OK. So you have podcast. Is I dca but precise? So very often i'll, uh, think of something. 

发言人2   02:00:03
I'll have some what I think is an insight. Yeah, I wanna tweet or write IT down. But in my mind i'm talking about on a podcast that's kind of how my mind registers that. 

发言人2   02:00:14
And for a while I thought this was a bad thing, and I tried to eradicate podcast naval. And then I just do this how IT comes out. So I might as well just be OK with IT. Now do you know the reason i'm on this podcast? You know, i've been done a proper formal interviews, strait up top, whatever, ten, twenty podcast along time. 

发言人1   02:00:31
Rogan, maybe, probably. 

发言人2   02:00:33
Miss rogan, yeah. When out of the top, right? 

发言人1   02:00:35
That was the fury. But still the top. 

发言人2   02:00:37
yeah, yeah. And I i've done some stuff. Tim, tim fares, good friend, but been more coal hosting. I haven't been a guest, and then I did wanted to. 

发言人2   02:00:44
Random things were just stumbled into a thing, right? You know, there was a reason, but IT wasn't like this. And I wish that to you for this one, right? 

发言人2   02:00:52
I have lots of people used to me for broadcast. I do not answer that. I reach out to you. And the reason is a really funny one is because when I am playing podcast in the all in my head for some reason in you on the other side, and I don't know why I really, really don't know why. It's not like I ve seen the many of your park as I have seen some snipper here and there, but for some reason you were the guy in the podcast, in podcast of all. And so as II, I, I wonder if this will close that . 

发言人1   02:01:19
loop or further in tranship. I wonder if you've made IT wait worse now and you're well, first off, I was a dream and now it's reality plus a dream and well. 

发言人2   02:01:27
now I don't get away from him yeah they're enough people that I turned down where I said and just might do podcast. I feel bad about that. I ve got to go back and do those podcast, but I am are my look and I nothing to talk about so I don't know . 

发言人1   02:01:38
what i'm going to I appreciate you'd set on rogan and this was something, you know, to kind of pay back to you. I had a five headed mount rushmore of guests before I started this show. And IT was Jordan Peterson, sam Harris, a land to bottom from the school of life, you and rogan. And that was my, a hydra of amount rush mall and I knew I think someone that asked you at some point maybe he was a tweet or something after rogan or maybe even said IT on rogan where you said, I don't like to say the same thing twice. 

发言人2   02:02:09
at least not in the same way I don't like equals yeah yes. 

发言人1   02:02:11
And I really, really respected that. You know, that was twenty nineteen he said he was eight and nine years ago was long. 

发言人2   02:02:19
I have a terrible memory yeah ah the twenty nine and code yes. 

发言人1   02:02:24
And I really appreciated that because there is something the content game you can continue to sort of, i'm sure, have said many things today that the audience already had. 

发言人1   02:02:36
But caring enough about having novel insights or at least having a new perspective on similar insights to how well you know in the space of six years since you're on jaw, a lot of these that i'm coming out actually the first thing I said you today, like i'm not convinced that actually fully agree with that thing that used to say, which is cool, right? That you yeah showing the position that you put in the ground previously is not a tether. It's not you being held to IT. 

发言人2   02:03:07
And I think the reason why I wanted to be on this is because for some reason I have the impression that you engage in conversations in all like conversations. I don't like interviews. This is why was doing my last start of air chat, which is all about conversations. 

发言人2   02:03:22
And conversations to me are more genuine. They're more authentic. There's a given take, there's a back. And for there's a genuine curiosity is not to say the other podcasts ers don't do IT, they absolutely do do IT. But for some reason in my mind, I had you as a guy that I would actually a conversation with. And sure enough, if you just read me your essay, which I don't think anybody really too right that implies is a given take as a genuine curiosity and I think that's useful because then uh, certain an explicit knowledge that I had will be surfaced for myself. I think that's helpful. 

发言人1   02:03:53
What you're seeing, you know going to break the fourth wall a bit. You're seeing very much of some of the gateway drug insides that you had that you just don't get to choose. I'm aware that you kind of have an anti guru sentiment in you like a very strong like . 

发言人2   02:04:12
don't listen to me. 

发言人1   02:04:13
I don't know what me do not about to me, do not do any of the other things to me. But if you see residence in another person, and I think this is what we're all trying to find, you people can complain about the mountains of content creation that happens, maybe rightly so. But if you're able to find someone and you see in them a little bit of you, maybe not even much of you, but like all that bit of them, they're a steam or the way they look at relationships. 

发言人1   02:04:40
So what they want to do, the kind of life they want to, the level of piece of mind that they want to have, whatever might be if you find in somebody else a little bit of that, it's kind of like what you saying before you can you can no longer be unconvinced of that. And IT a step, syn becomes a part of you. And yeah, you maybe seeing reflected back to use some you know this sort of percuss ted very meandering insight from, however, along ago that something happened maybe you know five years time will be like, you know that thing that you said about the lessons the and then I don't know it's caught that 3 thesis right is the sort of blending of the reason I spend . 

发言人2   02:05:18
a lot of time in same to tisco is because it's a gravitation attraction for the smartest people in the world。And despite all of the many problems the city had, because mismanaged beyond belief, IT does just seem to pull in the Young, smart, creative people uh not just the ones they're building technology but they're expLoring every fact life and they are weird and sometimes they are repulsive and is bizarre but you talk to these people and you just see a very intelligent person coming at life in a completely different way um putting you to the common attacks of human DNA which are accountable and giving you a weird perspective that can twist your mind around. 

发言人2   02:06:00
And to do that you always have to be learning you you have you can be a guru mentality if I with somebody and they're listening to every word I say and hanging on IT that's not interesting for me. I'm not to learn anything. Um I want people who are intelligent who will say something back that is a little different. I may not agree with that, but it's gonna ve in mark is going to leave in an impression and it's going to leave an impression to the extent that both that they are correct and that I choose to listen and i'll choose to listen if I don't view myself as higher status are smarter than them. The flip side of that is i'm not really impressed by high status people like . 

发言人1   02:06:37
I don't because pretty . 

发言人2   02:06:39
much in fact, uh, most of my friends, we've gone on to become very uh famous successful. The more famous sucessful they've been, the less I spend time with them partially because they gets surrounded by an army of sicker fans. This is hard to break through, uh, because I don't want anything from them. I don't like that. I don't like these situations in which transactional relationships are imply a gift. 

发言人1   02:07:01
though, to people who are of that because the hie that they climb up the hierarchy, the fewer and fewer people don't want anything from them. So in that way, yeah but we have even Better friend. 

发言人2   02:07:10
right? But they they get surrounded by people who do want things from them and are so good at pretending they don't that is just not work my time to try and break out from that group. Um so he does get lonely at the top sort to speak but this also by choice because you you can be problem . 

发言人1   02:07:25
yeah you can be your own best friend too. 

发言人2   02:07:28
I am my own best friend actually so I really do enjoy spending time . 

发言人1   02:07:32
with myself yeah the smartest people are interested in appearing smart and don't care what you think is yeah. 

发言人2   02:07:38
I mean, AA lot of life is not giving a shit, you know, but a lot of the best things in life come out of that. 

发言人1   02:07:44
Does this mean sort of talking about that route? Memorization master ating, his wisdom and insight thing, which I think IT perhaps almost certainly podcast like this, will have contributed to, you know, you hero, an landa bottom, whose a painter with words very simple, very sort of unpretentious. But if you're intellection curious, you see, you only see the production of his thoughts. You don't necessarily see the work that's gone into the thoughts behind. So you confuse the presentation of them for the insight. 

发言人2   02:08:22
Does that make sense? Of course? Yeah a lot a lot of my stuff is more polished like one of the funny things yeah one of funny things that uh right before this, uh, podcast was, I thought maybe even go back and read my old tweet just I remember what I said like an article that at, well then I read that this performance I would just be members zing . 

发言人1   02:08:41
my whole stuck to perform I that's an extra special level of exactly how the eve to send that memorizing . 

发言人2   02:08:48
me to be more me bingo up some expectation or some uh, famous personality that now have . 

发言人1   02:08:54
to become some jacket to bate. 

发言人2   02:08:57
right? So of course, pretty quickly I saw through that. No, it's nonsense and I also constrains my time and . 

发言人1   02:09:03
it's just work I think your meditation practice that worked at that mindfulness . 

发言人2   02:09:07
gap to be like. 

发言人1   02:09:08
huh yeah there's that . 

发言人2   02:09:10
thing again in exactly that. So it's not about changing your thoughts. It's not about fixing your thoughts, not about changing yourself is just about being observing of yourself so that you can then IT automatically change. 

发言人2   02:09:20
Whatever change needs to happen will happen is you try to change yourself is very circular. Um the mind trying to change the mind, the mind doesn't let rustling with itself. II don't think IT gets anywhere. 

发言人1   02:09:31
You've spent a lot of time either creating wealth, thinking about how to create wealth. What if you learned are the best places to spend wealth. 

发言人2   02:09:42
to spend wealth? 

发言人1   02:09:44
Yeah, yeah. How you spend this time creating this wealth, accumulating? How does what are the best ways fee to put IT back out? 

发言人2   02:09:53
I actually think elan had this one figured out, which is he poured his own money back into his own businesses to go do bigger and Better things for humanity. Um so what I would like to you know, you could give IT a non profits, but love on profits a griffe or its people who didn't earn IT try to spend IT or they don't have tight feedback loops on having a good effect. So one of things I want to do as an aside as I want to create a little school for Young physicists. 

发言人1   02:10:17
but that's that's Young physicists . 

发言人2   02:10:19
yeah that that's my non property thing. But um and i've been and i've actually um under written a media and some physical stuff. I like talk about IT. I don't talk about my whatever so called full anthropy because I think that makes IT less real. That makes more less fill in problem. 

发言人1   02:10:36
Yeah exactly. Then people get how charity, my charity is. 

发言人2   02:10:39
and then people also come hunting for money. So there's all that disease I don't believe in giving the schools. They have enough money, I believe, have enough money and they not to spend IT. So I think the best use of money is, I think a good business, create a product for people that they're voluntarily by and they get value out of. So in that sense of Steve jobs and iron and and like that have created a lot of value for the world. 

发言人2   02:11:02
So one of the things I can do is I can take my own money and I can invest IT in myself to go and build the next great thing that I think needs to exist. And that's basically what i'm doing right now. I'm doing a new business. 

发言人2   02:11:13
I'm self funding IT. I'm flying a lot of money into IT. I'm going to build something that I think is beautiful that I want to see exist um I really want . 

发言人1   02:11:21
to see existence. It's so early it's . 

发言人2   02:11:23
we will show a few months, hopefully six months um and i'm excited about IT and that's a good use of money. 

发言人1   02:11:32
What about the worst places to spend wealth? 

发言人2   02:11:36
What is the old line if he flies for loads . 

发言人1   02:11:39
of four tickets? I got very nice way to change the final left. Very impressive. 

发言人2   02:11:44
That's the way I heard IT. 

发言人1   02:11:46
Can you created pretty . 

发言人2   02:11:47
much fast but yeah yeah, yeah I think that was maybe IT was a felix denis OK who who had that quite yeah said if the flies float for fornix rented I think the last one was a little it's wrong that he he didn't have a family, didn't have kids. So you know he missed the big one um but yeah, there are lots of bad ways to spend money. III believe in investment. 

发言人2   02:12:11
You know I don't believe in consumption. Yes, you can. You born with a short housing position, you close that out yourself, a nice house um get yourself some help to free up your time so you're not doing uh things that other people can do Better um treat people well, you know always overpay and expect the best. 

发言人2   02:12:27
Pay them like they the best, expect the best um but overall, I think a good use of money is to take risks and build things and do things that other people can't do. Align with your own unique talents they can keep delivering to the world. I'm not going to set idle uh the not at a retire that's that's a waste to whatever time I have left on this earth. 

发言人2   02:12:48
Um and if I am doing something, I enjoy the propel retirement because work is just a set of things you want to do that that that you have to do that you don't want to do so if you want to do IT as much um and so there are things that I want to do don't feel like work. I can put money behind them and I can use that to make the intention ate them into reality. And I don't want to say to make the world a Better place because that's too tired, but it's more just create a product that I am proud of that wouldn't exist otherwise that other people will get tremendous value. 

发言人1   02:13:18
And it's been enabled through wealth because you're able to take a level of risk that you wouldn't have been able to other actually yeah. 

发言人2   02:13:23
wealth gives you freedom. That gives you freedom to explore more options. And in my case, that gives me freedom to start businesses without having to ask other people for permission or to warp my vision based on, uh, their desires to make a return or how they think money should be made. 

发言人1   02:13:40
Is anything that you'd add to the how to get rid thread? Is anything where you thought fact, like just one, if I could, going and edit and add one more in other . 

发言人2   02:13:50
ten thousand pic onest read was so short and I was so limited and IT was so like, you know, craft did in the sense, although I wrote IT very spontaneous ly um IT left so much on the cutting room floor that I could just talk about the topic for days. But it's all contextual, right? 

发言人2   02:14:08
Business is very, very, very contextual like you have to look at the particular business and understand what's being done and why it's being done and how it's being done. And then you can Terry apart or you can and then we assemble IT properly. Um and i'd like to think that, that is actually where I have specific knowledge and experts, my Operations. 

发言人2   02:14:27
And yes, my life is very hacked to be very unique, but I don't think that's where my specific knowledge is. My special knowledge is in being able to analyze a business, especially technology business, and take IT apart at the seems and predict in advance what is likely to work and what is not likely to work. Clubhouse outward standing because you're still going to be wrong most of the time. 

发言人2   02:14:51
It's like playing the lottery. But you know one or two of the tickets numbers in advance, you only have to be right a few times, or even just wants to to get the big score. You know, Peter till started a paypal, but he made my own facebook right? And now he's done more since then, obviously. 

发言人2   02:15:05
Ep, but that was the big winner and that's true. Any power law distribution number one is going to return more than two, three and put together two return more than three, three input together, you're Operating in a highly leverage intellectual domain. So the outcomes are going to be nonlinear AR. Um so II know a lot about the topic is highly contextual IT makes a lot more sense if there's a specific business in front of me, a specific entrepreneur and I can take that apart. I can say, you know so there are certain companies well say, oh, this is not onna work because you, the entrepreneur are doing this for the wrong reasons. 

发言人2   02:15:36
You're you're doing a so you can get to b just go to b or you're doing this to make money when really the person who is doing this because they love the product is going to beat you or you are raising money for the wrong people who are any for the wrong reasons or your cofounder is not the right reasons or you don't have the right kind of co founder or your vesting schedule is wrong or you're starting the business in the wrong place or you approaching IT from this angle that that and of course, I be wrong too, but I ve just seen a lot of data. I have my theories around IT, uh, and that's where I feel very comfortable Operating. The problem is when I have talk about how to create wealth and how to get rich is a click bid title deliberately. 

发言人2   02:16:14
But when I talk about how to create wealth, talking about in the abstract is very difficult. Because then you just want to speak truth. You have to just see the timeless stuff. You have to be right. And almost every context. 

发言人1   02:16:27
and that really limits what you can . 

发言人2   02:16:29
say specifically kes IT correct. Expect to philosophy. When I can get specific about IT. The real knowledge is like a welcome. Yeah, part of the reason why I started doing podcast, you know, this is ego at place a little bit freely when I was twisting, you know, I kind of pioneer philosophy, twitter, if you will, or a certain kind of practical, physical hy twitter, where in one hundred forty characters I would try to say something true in an interesting way that was insights to me at the time, but then I can copy. 

发言人2   02:16:57
There's thousands of us now, right, thousands of people spitting IT out ChatGPT trying to create these things all day long um although like to say I like to think that my stuff is incompressible and saying IT in the title way possible which is kind of a little failed poetry background but what I realized was if you truly have a deep understanding of something, then you can talk about a holiday long, then you can read ive everything you need from that understanding. No memorialization you can get to from first principles and every piece of what you know is is like a it's like a legal block that just fits in and forms a steel frame is solid, it's locked in there. And so on a podcast, I can unload much more deeply about some of these topics. Um so for example, we can talk about any business you like, but IT has to be in context, IT has to be real. IT has to be an actual problem then we can solve . 

发言人1   02:17:49
IT just really love that heroic of if you're having to memorize something. 

发言人2   02:17:53
it's because you don't understand, you don't understand IT, that's right. If you have to memorize something, you don't understand that and if you understand something you don't memorize IT. 

发言人1   02:18:01
Yeah again, you know, just a sort of called out a lot of what I tried to do this redemption arc thing of if I sound smart, that's like being smart, right? 

发言人2   02:18:15
ChatGPT is memorized the entire internet good. Like competing with that. You're not going to beat the memorization. You're not going to be the library memorials, going to be any ten books and memorize. So memorization is not the thing and . 

发言人1   02:18:29
memorial is going down by the day. 

发言人2   02:18:31
It's already so low. Understanding is a thing, being able to being able judgment is a thing, taste is a thing. Um and understanding, judgment, taste, these come out of having real problems and then solving them and then finding the commonalities. 

发言人2   02:18:46
What is philosophy? Everyone, you live long enough, you will be philosopher. Philosophy is just when you find they hidden generalizable truths among the specific experiences that you've had in life, and then you know how to navigate future specific experiences based on some this, and you create a philosophy around that. 

发言人2   02:19:02
Any subject persued deeply enough eventually lead to philosophy. Mastering anything, literally anything, will lead you to being a philosopher. You just have to stick with a long enough and generalize the truth backup. 

发言人2   02:19:12
And these are universal truth. It's back to the unity and variety. You can find. You can find unit in anything if you go deep enough. 

发言人1   02:19:19
And that's why the tide stuff, unfortunately, sort of keeps coming back around. You like, well, luck. This is clay for . 

发言人2   02:19:25
kind of a reason cause for reasons uh but you know sometimes you learn new things. Sometimes you do figure out new things to a even even in philosophy for example, scientists advanced as science as advance is actually expanded our boundaries of philosophy um when we used to think that uh knew the earth was the center of the universe, you would actually have a different philosophical outlook. 

发言人2   02:19:48
Then when you think the universe is vast and we're in fantastic small IT will give you a different physical hc outlook. Uh the same way if you think that uh the nature there is driven by Angels and demons and gods versus if there are laws of physics that are computable and understandable that will lead you to a different philosophical outlook. Uh if you think that knowledge is something that is passed down from above and through generations, which is something that is created on the fly and then tested against reality that will lead a different physical hc outlook. If you think humans are created by god as opposed to humans evolved from some, you know you cell or organism, yes, still doesn't solve the original problems that. 

发言人1   02:20:30
but at least that takes you take on the road. 

发言人2   02:20:33
even symptoms, is an attempt at reform. That in philosophy, based on what we know about computers, even the kind of lead a lot of the same, but IT is at least philosophy that is informed by technology and by science. So philosophy can also involve involved. 

发言人2   02:20:47
Moral philosophy involves, right? Uh, there was a time when every culture, practically, there was a congress culture, practice slavery. Now, almost all cultures of our slavery, that's moral philosophy having evolved. You know, there was even like the sounds too ludgate to be true, and I don't know if IT fully is true, but there were AA fairly large group of doctors based on studies who believed until the one thousand nine hundred eighties that babies couldn't feel pain. 

发言人2   02:21:13
And so even to this, I think circumvention is done without anxious and because under the theory that you know very Young children, bb don't feel pain course, so people can be stuck in bad philosophical traps for a long period time, so even philosophe can make progress. And uh, as an example, one of the realization that I had this is stinks to uh, David doyle and my friend James pearson. Also thinking IT through a little bit is that there are these timeless old questions that we run into where the answer seemed like paradoxes. 

发言人2   02:21:47
So we stop thinking about them. So an examples, free will. Do you have free will, or does anything matters or meaning to life? And and we get stuck in them because, for example, is there a meaning to life? Like, yes, life has a because you, you're right here. You create your own meaning. 

发言人2   02:22:02
This, this moment has all the meaning you could imagine all the meaning there is on their hand, you gonna die, all goes zero heat of the universe has no meaning, right? So which one is IT? Well, the reason that seems paradox xcl is because you're asking the question of a human here now, at a certain scale, in a certain time, and then you're answering IT from the viewpoint of the universe over infinite time. 

发言人2   02:22:24
So you pull the trick, you switch the level at which you answer the question, and question should be answered at the level at which they asked. So if you ask the question is the meaning you, Chris, are asking that question yes yes to Chris, there is meaning. There is a meaning right here. 

发言人2   02:22:39
This is the meaning interpretation you want onto IT um don't ask the question as Chris and answered as god, as the universe. That's the trick that you're playing. That's what IT seems the same way you can say, do I have free will? People debate free will all day long. 

发言人2   02:22:53
The question is answered at the wrong frame, so they asked the questions, do I and individual have free will? Hello, I have free will. My mind body system can predict what i'm going to do next. 

发言人2   02:23:04
The universe, infinite, complex. I'm making a choice in my mind i'm doing, there's my free will. So I answered the level which you will ask. Of course, I have free will because I feel like I have free will, and I treat you like you free will, and you treat me like I freewill. We have free will. 

发言人2   02:23:17
The problem then, if you start trying to answer the question as if you, the universe you like, all on the universal scale, big bank particle collision? No, what makes any choices? You know, how could you be any different than what the universe wanted to be? And is all one block universe so you don't have free will? Don't answer the question at the level at which IT wasn't asked. 

发言人2   02:23:33
So god ask the question, is there free will? No, there is no free will. The universe asked a question, there is no free will. But if an individual ask a question right now, then, yes, there is free. Well, so a lot of these paradoxes resolve themselves, philosophical paradoxes that people i've been struggling with since of being a time when you just realized you're answering them at a scale and time different than they were asked. 

发言人1   02:23:53
Speaking of updating beliefs, is anything that you change? You remind around recently. 

发言人2   02:24:00
very recently, I mean, at all the time. But are you talking about like philosophical. 

发言人1   02:24:06
like essential things, or like technological things? Yeah, philosophical existe anything that . 

发言人2   02:24:12
comes to money, if you, yeah, then I used to be in a societal level, I think that culture and religion are good CoOperating systems for humans. And so if you want to Operate a hydra society, you need to have sets of rules that people need to follow base. They get a long one size fit. S all doesn't work . 

发言人1   02:24:28
a little bit from libertarian. yeah. 

发言人2   02:24:30
I pure libertarians get out competed and die. They get over run because they're every man for himself. They can't code. They can ordinate the right um so the coordination problems culture exists to solve fundamental coordination problems religion solve coordination problems ethically solves coordination problems historical um and when you break down those coordination systems too fast and don't replace them with anything else, you get societal breakdown so you can have very malfunctioning societies. 

发言人2   02:24:58
You know, go to japan, where is a go into western city and you can see the difference being AAA culture that's working in a culture that's not so II think that that's like AAA broader set of things that I ve changed my mind on AA fair bit. I used to be much more lazy fair on that stuff, let's put that way. Um what else? I mean, child raising, i've gotten a lot loser. You know i'm still not like completely the fair, but i'm much more realized like kids are going to be kids and you can let them do their thing. This is IT taliban . 

发言人1   02:25:27
has the ascending levels of like anechoic m versus conservative m is that his inside like at the local level on this IT seems like you've gotten the other way like . 

发言人2   02:25:38
at . 

发言人1   02:25:38
the child level and anus, the societal level. 

发言人2   02:25:41
Yeah, no, he was quoting somebody else, some brothers. I forget which ones, but he was making the point. Equality, as he often does, that uh, at at the family local level, he's a communist. 

发言人2   02:25:54
St, the family level are communist, uh, at maybe the the extended family level of you are socialist. The local level you're kind of a，uh, a democrat and so on. Until that, the federal level, your libertarian. 

发言人1   02:26:06
right? You ve done in the other way, you liberati with the kids and your religious . 

发言人2   02:26:12
service ety. I don't I don't know the scale. Is that that simple? Um what also change my mind on I mean, I think the modern AI is really cool. I think it's but I think these are nurse language computers um they are starting to show evidence of kind of uh, reasoning at some levels but I don't think they do creativity. I think modern AI. 

发言人1   02:26:34
So just on that, one of my favorite takes is from door cash petalled in. He says, a if you gave any human on the planet, not point, not not, not one percent of the consumption. That LLM has any L. 

发言人1   02:26:49
M. They would have come up with thousands of new ideas, right? Give me one new idea. 

发言人2   02:26:56
A new idea generated. 

发言人1   02:26:57
Yeah, I get in the poetry. 

发言人2   02:27:00
Every power never written by an alm is garbage. I think even their fiction writing is terrible. Even the new GP, T, four, five with all do respect to samon crew, I think they're terrible writers. 

发言人2   02:27:08
I find them really bad at summarizing. They're really good extrapolating, you know, paperwork. They're very bad at actually distilling the essence of something and what's important. They don't have an opinions or a point of view, but they're still unbelievably powerful. breakthrough. They solve search, they solve natural language computing, they make english a programing language to solve driving, this solve uh, simple coding and backup coding, this solve translation, this solve tranest ript. 

发言人2   02:27:33
There are a fundamental breakthrough in computing, is a different way to program a computer, rather than you explicit speak its language, right the code, and then runs the data through users, runs of data through IT until the figures out how to write the program. That's huge. But are they are they AGI not yet. 

发言人2   02:27:49
I don't see a direct path from here to there. Um maybe we'll have to solve a few more problems before that happens. And I think AS size of fantasy. I don't think such uh, artificial super intelligence where IT has some kind of intelligence . 

发言人1   02:28:05
that humans can find them OK a yeah IT seems like I don't know if you from the boston camp or whatever in no. 

发言人2   02:28:12
I do, but I think that's such a flawed . 

发言人1   02:28:15
line of reasoning. But let's say that you came out of the last dom and there was this sort of lining age from computers. And AI gets more powerful, more powerful, more powerful. 

发言人1   02:28:28
And then you end up aga s and IT. Seems like l ms. Have been the sort of orthogonal move from that. Which are you saying you don't believe they are a step on that is of a little bit of yeah think a different branch. 

发言人2   02:28:41
I think Steven wolf puts a Better to different form of intelligence. It's like you jg or in the jungle that has a different form of intelligence and you're like a plant as a form of intelligence, how you can like photosynthesize and grow. It's a different form of intelligence. 

发言人2   02:28:53
It's not an intelligence. Again, like love or like happiness is overload word. That means many things to many people. 

发言人2   02:28:58
But by my definition, where you know the true tested, you get what you want out of life. He does not want to have a life. He does not want anything a different thing um I do think it's unbelievable useful. I'm glad that IT exists. You don't see IT much yet in large scale production systems replacing humans because this tendency to illustrates so you can't put IT into . 

发言人1   02:29:18
anything this ca one time out of and IT . 

发言人2   02:29:20
does even know when it's wrong, uh, and maybe theyll get that one out of ten down to one out of a hundred. But you kind of always want human oversight for critical to al things. 

发言人1   02:29:31
I always feel so bitter it's i'm pty. Sometimes my less version of me is petty and I always want to like teach you a lesson if I get something wrong like how to know you was so comfort. I'm treating IT. But repositioning IT doesn't have a . 

发言人2   02:29:44
point of view and they are gonna a lot Better. And they might get to the point where the air rates are so low that you can put them into certain bounded problems like self driving. I think we'll be solved completely because it's a bounded problem. 

发言人2   02:29:56
Cars do you know, go like off road and drive through houses and stuff like that. So because same way, like certain kinds of coding, the creative side of coding, I think, doesn't go away. I think if anything, programmer get even more leverage, more powerful. And rather than computing, replacing programmer, programmer use AI to replace everybody . 

发言人1   02:30:14
else on a test levers is way more would you bet on software or hardware self driving? 

发言人2   02:30:19
yeah. So I think testers in the stronger, longer term position, but it's hard to argue what's working right now and we will is working right now. So I would not underestimate them because there's a learning curve that you go through when you actually deploy something. 

发言人2   02:30:31
And we as we had in that regard. But text less camera only approach, if IT works, is a superior, is much more scalable. And tesla knows how to print cars, right? They can just mass manufacturer cars. But I think I think we'll both be around we'll both be fine. Everybody else who doesn't have a self driving . 

发言人1   02:30:49
vehicle that screwed you mentioned the kids there. You had a tweet that said, i'm not convinced that declining futility needs to be proactively fought. 

发言人2   02:30:58
I forgot that . 

发言人1   02:31:00
one I do. Um why? 

发言人2   02:31:02
Well II think back like I was thirty years ago, twenty years ago everybody was think over population of the earth to be a problem usia. We're going to have people and a few people part of IT is just the duma ism meme is always alive and well, right? Just packet. 

发言人2   02:31:16
Yeah I we're running out of oil with too much oil, right? You know, it's like the world is cooling. The world is warming. 

发言人2   02:31:21
Like there's always something scream about the world is ending. There's no progress in technology. AS gona blow the world, right? So people tend to overdo in both directions. 

发言人2   02:31:30
Now, what is the actual fertility problem? right? Well, people are having less kids. 

发言人2   02:31:34
Are they having less kids? Because there's a disease? Was there a virus that they lose their fertility? 

发言人2   02:31:40
The microplate tics and the text, no, it's people are having less kids because they're choosing to have less kids, right? Women have have gotten immanence pated independence in the workforce. They're making more money. 

发言人2   02:31:50
Um people don't need kids and insurance policies. They have less kids may be they're living here in the stick lives, got blessin want more fun. They want of these kids. 

发言人2   02:31:57
I don't see the act of choosing to have less kids is a problem OK. So let's move one level up. Uh, it's because the retirees it's because a large present of the population is essentially retiring at the guarantee age of sixty five ty. 

发言人2   02:32:12
And so they need other people to pay for IT. They need more workers in the workforce. And if the workforce is shrinking, then you have a small number of people exactly who are supporting a large number of retirees. 

发言人2   02:32:22
And in democracies, you can take pensions away if the voters vote you out. So this slowly struggle, the economy. So what do you do? Then you have a bunch of immigration. 

发言人2   02:32:30
And then the whole culture changes in another low trust society. And people start fighting over limited resources and how to control which immigrants come in. How do you make sure that they're good taxpayers after they're in and so on. 

发言人2   02:32:40
So you end up with in in kind of trap where the low fertility rate is upstream of the dow stream. Problems that our cultural, social, but i'm not sure that you're going to solve that by making people have more kids. How are you gonna mean them into having more kids and not even sure it's still be a problem. 

发言人2   02:32:57
Keep in mind, you have more resources now. You have less of a burden now. The flip side where every kid is a lottery ticket, my invention. So there's some benefit to having more kids, but you you can force IT. I think it'll work itself out, right? 

发言人2   02:33:11
The Scott Adams is just a great log, which cause the Adams's love slowed ing disasters when disasters are very slow moving, like p oil, or global warming, or population collapse, and everyone can to see them coming. Economics and society is a force seldom m because enough individual people has since tatis to go solve them. So I don't know exactly how IT gets solved, but I think I could get solved in various ways. 

发言人2   02:33:39
Uh one example could be um you know maybe people retire later, maybe AI automation and robots take care. The older people maybe we figure how to have immigrants while still keeping a hy trust society. We kind of put more rules on immigration that protects them with a high trust benefits. 

发言人2   02:33:56
Maybe we outsource more things. Maybe we just, you know, have more land and housing to go around blame. We are having too many kids. 

发言人2   02:34:02
I would be complain about how there's no housing and there's no land. So they will always find something to care about. So I just don't view this as like a thing that any individual or government action is going to solve. I think economics and incentives over time will solve IT. And i'm not even convinced like that big of a problem. 

发言人1   02:34:19
Is there anything that you do think . 

发言人2   02:34:21
is IT may be self correcting too, which is that if there are too few kids in society in the returns to having . 

发言人1   02:34:29
kids literally might just go up IT might just . 

发言人2   02:34:32
be easier to have the incentive to now have a . 

发言人1   02:34:36
child because there's inside, which is you look at all of the other people around who don't have kids. Let's say that pensions completely drop off. And the only way that old people are able to survive if their children paid them some sort of type ends, like reverse send money up to generations OK. Well, that's a pretty fucking good. 

发言人2   02:34:54
Incentives is a good thing. I also think that people have been meant into thinking that kids make your life worse. And that's that's a pretty. 

发言人1   02:35:00
pretty bad. 

发言人2   02:35:01
What about my kids? Make your life Better in every possible way, if you, if you want an automatic building meeting to life, have kids. Uh, and I think they're these bad psych studies like most site studies, unfortunately, that say that people are unhappy when they have kids. 

发言人2   02:35:14
Yes, because you're catching in the midst, changing a dire and you're saying, like, are you glad you had kids are not say that they say, are you happy and they say, no, are not happy right now. But what they don't realize that person is found something more important than being happy in the moment they found meaning. And the meaning comes from kids. 

发言人2   02:35:30
And if you ask parents, do you regret having kids? I think would be nine, nine to one against, you know, I would be, no, I don't regret having kids. I love having kids. I'm so glad I had kids. It's incredibly rare to meet a parent that regretted having children. 

发言人2   02:35:43
H it's it's extremely good odds and I think so I think I think a lot of people get late into life and uh then they can admit that they didn't want kid, that they should have had kids. It's kind of late in the game um but you know a lot of times you see everybody who has a pet, right uh and they're pushing them around in a stoller. What is that that's a sublimate and . 

发言人1   02:36:05
desire for children yeah a malcolm Collins says that having a pet is to children as using porn is to sex. He basically thinks that it's . 

发言人2   02:36:13
sort of a sorry goods. It's definitely in that direction. And now I don't have. I like pets. I like animals. I don't but I don't like the idea of like neutering or spaying something and then keeping IT as a prisoner in the house and having to train that you know I don't want to be responsible for that is. 

发言人1   02:36:29
given that you've been thinking more about child wearing kids, what do you hope that your kids learn from their childhood? 

发言人2   02:36:36
This is be happy to what they want. I don't I don't have particular goals in mind for them. I think that's a that's another right . 

发言人1   02:36:44
to unhappiness having right learn, learn of his goals is not necessary. What do they want? What do you want them to want out of life? Like what is that the you have idea around your number one job as a parent is to provide unconditional level of, yeah that's right. So I can be loved, or I am loved unconditionally. 

发言人2   02:37:01
Is that one of the things and my kids to feel unconditionally loved, and I want them to have high self steam as a consequence of that. But I don't get to choose any all. I get to choose on my output. 

发言人2   02:37:13
I can output love. I can choose what they feel. I can choose how they behave. I can choose what they want. I can choose what they turn out to be. 

发言人1   02:37:21
And downstream from that, there should be freedom. There should be a degree of freedom that comes from the self system that comes from the unconditional. 

发言人2   02:37:28
should make their own mistakes and learn their own lessons and have their own desires and fulfill them as is appropriate. Um I like any parent, I wouldn't want them to be hurt, I wouldn't want them to be unhappy, but I cannot control these things. 

发言人1   02:37:41
Um you replied to my friends rob henderson, who was talking about um how kids fall asleep more quickly when they're being Carried. Uh, he said, cry IT out and go sleeping is dangerous. What's IYI science? 

发言人2   02:37:55
II was a museum teeb a intellectual at idiot. These are people who are over educated. They deny like basic common sense. Okay uh so there's a lot of that that goes on in child rearing uh thanks to really bad studies uh and and bad public medical directive. So for example, you know uh a few uh a few parents, you may be they are drunker, they're high or they are just other issues and you know they rule over their kid when sleeping, the kids soft cates, or they nickleby their . 

发言人1   02:38:24
kid and go sleep in the . 

发言人2   02:38:26
but yeah exactly or there you know the the modern program tion. And so because of that they say we don't go sleep with their kids. Well, the kids, every society through all of human history, coat with their parents. 

发言人2   02:38:37
Where else you think they were sleeping? They were in house of multiple room. Yeah exactly. IT is just nonsense. Coast sleeping has been around since the dawn of time so has a feeding kids cow milk when or goat milk when breast milk is runs out or is not available um yet we're told formula you know made with soy and corn sera which was invented recently, somehow Better than uh cow milk and cow milk can be dangerous for your kids and cosy evening is dangerous for your kids and cried out right answer all that is nonsense. I mean it's very clear that um we raise children throughout human history without uh these interventions. 

发言人2   02:39:15
To me, the idea that like you let your kid cry out, I get why that's done for practical reasons so that you know you can get some sleep and you can go to work in the morning. But the reality is when you let the kid cried out, you're letting the kid ball until they finally gives up. I mean, a kid left by itself to cry IT out in the world going to get eaten, right? It's going to get to eat by tiger. Um so this kid is starting off in the wrong foundation. The the the one I mentioned earlier about the idea that babies don't feel pain like that's ludicrously i've never heard of yes. 

发言人1   02:39:44
it's such a while. Yeah. 

发言人2   02:39:45
that's one hundred percent too. I read IT. 

发言人1   02:39:48
I read IT in the cheek quite hard. 

发言人2   02:39:50
That's category ID on twitter. And I did one level confirmation on IT but that I should really do two confirmations on IT before I talk about IT. Um but they're definitely some people who believe that they're enough that I was a thing um in certain circles for a while. 

发言人2   02:40:05
But I think we just go through these know these IYI believe is intellectually, if he believes come from people who uh take a little bit of knowledge and extrapolated too far, they think we know more than we know due to recent scientific studies. And these are junk science. These are low power studies on uh you know on very certain context that they get over applied behavior. 

发言人2   02:40:28
Psych is very guilty of this, but it's true across a lot of science um so even with science you have to be skeptical. You have to look very carefully add you know does applying the right context or not is come from good sources that they run enough high power studies of why the accepted and they're whole bunch of things you're just not supposed to talk about. You're not supposed to say like you don't say like you you can say anything negative about a vaccine because, god forbid, what if they don't get the polio vaccine right? And that's part of the reason why the recent vaccine debate, because we've taken our worship for vaccines too far, because we don't want people to not take nonessential of vaccines. 

发言人2   02:40:59
So IT done the same way. There is whole sids thing, sudden infant death, th syndrome, right right now. There's kids don't suddenly, mysteriously died, like more likely there was neglect or there was a problem. 

发言人2   02:41:11
And then whoever was a caretaker doesn't want to admit to the problem. We didn't reregulate ze the problem. But kids don't just spontaneous ly die the grip right um so they talk about sweetling babies. You swallow babies you know basically tie them, mom fy them uh so you constrict them so they die of sids when they rolled over and they can get back is all this crazy? That's around . 

发言人1   02:41:32
racing field. 

发言人2   02:41:33
It's a minefield and and you know you have these scared parents are having kid for the first time and they open a book and the start reading how to raise children. I would argue that your natural instincts on what to do with your child, uh, are actually pretty good. It's it's funny when, uh, my wife and I had her first baby, I remember, you know, at the hospital. 

发言人2   02:41:51
So the first of the natural birth at the birthing center, we we went home. I was like, there you go. That's IT. 

发言人2   02:41:56
We're like, what do we do? Where's in manually? You taken home and then you relaxing. 

发言人2   02:42:03
You actually instinct, ts are pretty good. You know, if the kid cries, check to see the clean freedom, all that. Your basic instincts are actually very, very good. And kids instincts are actually very, very good. They know what they want and they want things . 

发言人1   02:42:18
for a reason and they can encourage . 

发言人2   02:42:20
you to give IT to them. Yes, it's usually children are not deficient adults who can reason uh and to some extent that's true, but mostly it's not true. Mostly they have very good reasons for what they want. 

发言人2   02:42:34
And you, as a parent, mostly have communication problems with them. They can't yet communicate to you. You can communicate to them. They can communicate to you. So early out with my kids, I tried to focus on teaching them, you know, basic explantatory theories and assume having the number of things. 

发言人1   02:42:53
It's just the most. 

发言人2   02:42:55
the most noval soly. Give you a very simple example. 

发言人1   02:42:58
right? This is, yeah, and this is, this is the how to get rich without getting lucky through. So the first one. 

发言人2   02:43:05
a simple one, is, you know, how does knowledge get created? If you follow the critical rational ism David dodge philosophy, then it's by guessing and then by testing your guesses. So whenever they asked me something like body, you think that is, well, how would we figure if that's true, right? So that basic game you can play involving them involving them. But another one is that a lot of the rules that you teach kids have to do with hygiene, but you must brush your teeth, you know cover your mouth when you cough um you know clean up after yourself, don't touch that, wash your hands after you do this um don't eat food off the floor right but all of these are subsumed under the germ theory of disease, right? So if you instead go on youtube and show the videos of germs, or if you have him looking into a microscope at anything. 

发言人1   02:43:50
creepy call is everywhere. 

发言人2   02:43:52
and I onta watch out for them. Uh, and then, you know, you can talk about how, if, if you look at humans, like our real enemy of pathogens, I think a lot of aging and diseases, actually downstream of our competition with pathogens over time, a to a point that people still don't fully appreciate. Um there is a red queen hypothesis, which is that we undergo sexual selection to mix up our genes. 

发言人2   02:44:13
And so every twenty years, every generation mix up jeans. But if you look at how bacteria and viruses mutate through just random mutations, they mix up rate on their genes and evolution rate is roughly the same as ours. Even though they go through thousands of generations, twenty years because they're not doing sexual election, they're doing a sexual replication mutation. 

发言人2   02:44:32
Their evolutionary rate is roughly equivalent to our so we're in a red queen race where where both running at the roughly the same speed using very different strategies. But a lot of how we involved is around pathogens like our immune system is one of the most expensive things around the body is so much is about immune system optimization. That's about pathogens. 

发言人2   02:44:52
Junk DNA in bacteria, Christopher was discovered because in bacteria, their DNA is evolving fied viruses. And the IT does. That is by taking viral DNA snipping IT up every time there's a val attack and storing IT in their own DNA, they were copy so they can recognize that next time IT attacks and so on. 

发言人2   02:45:10
Um a lot of the population structure of species uh determines how long their lifespans are so very uh so if if in a given species is a very high rate of infection, then you'll have this order members of the population are Carrying diseases that will then infect the Young. So it's important for that species to get rid of the old faster. So the higher the disease rate in a given population, the less long live the entire population. 

发言人2   02:45:38
So the older ones don't affect the Younger ones that a high um uh homeostasis within the human body, how we're always returning to a given level of things like that, this a fundamental part of a makeup or temperature, PH, blood pressure and sign homeless staes. But if you if you engage a kind of signaling, like you take a pep type, for example, as a signaling molecules hormone externally, the body will counteract IT you take to stop, the body will counteract IT will downgrades on production very fast? And the body releases its own hormones in pulses rather than steady state. 

发言人2   02:46:11
Why is that? Well, that's because, uh, bacteria and viruses can infect your body and trick your body that can take IT over that toxic lus. Moses, does this rabies? Does this take over? Microscopic structure, structural bodies and small bacteria and viruses would hack our bodies and literally take them over if we didn't have defense mechanisms. 

发言人2   02:46:28
And one of the defense mechanisms is homeostasis. Anytime you see something getting out of wac, you immediately push back really hard. And because I did, I just get infected or something trying to take me over. 

发言人2   02:46:38
It's also why hormones get released in pulses at night rather than in steady state, low levels because, uh, enemy bacteria can release toxins or the same signal molecules in small qualities, but they can't pulse. They can coordinate to pulse, so your body coordinate the ultra microscopic object, but microscopic objects can coordinate to create the same place. cool. yeah. 

发言人1   02:47:00
So this is all means. So you know that it's coming from you. Is that correct? 

发言人2   02:47:03
You think is right than exit. 

发言人1   02:47:05
So I knew that why we resist . 

发言人2   02:47:07
a lot of exhaustion, ous treatments, a lot of medical treatments don't work um anyway. So this there's a bunch more I can go on, but I think that uh a lot of uh no you you see this in cancers where uh a lot of uh bacteria show up at the FN bar bar shows up in a lot of cancers, you know, now that seems like to get microbiome fluency. 

发言人2   02:47:29
So many things, basically, bacteria and viruses are at the top of the food chain compared to us, like we are the top of the well known food chain. But bacteria and viruses eat us. Funs eats us. 

发言人2   02:47:40
So these microscopic predators are our natural predators. And so a lot of aging, societal structure hyg e religious structures against pork, you know, circumstance, all of these things, these are all designed to resist spector viruses. So if you can teach children this phone, sophy, in early age, you should cut all the debates. 

发言人1   02:48:00
How effective, if you've been a teaching that philosophy to children. 

发言人2   02:48:03
that one, I think i've been pretty effective. I've drill that one at home, the one I haven't quite gotten around to yet as evolution like i'm starting to do little bit that know like we came from monkeys what does that mean um already got them thinking about somebody deeper questions. I did ask my you know Young son like you know can nothing exist? 

发言人2   02:48:20
I know that has a fun questions, so I can throw a fun, you know, like four, three h right, what in eight year old, six year old. So asking both, I can, nothing exists and they have pretty good answers, right? Another one we play with the other day was like, what is the matrix and what what is this? What is all this? I just find and it's entertaining. 

发言人2   02:48:40
It's just found to talk about, right, to talk about these questions, to do kids. I'm not saying that one is a good way of child and his leading any deeper learning other than maybe just have them start a or continue to question the basic structure reality and that move past IT so quickly. Also, to take joy. 

发言人1   02:48:56
you like what what's the metal lesson that's being taught? dad? Dad spends time asking questions to which they are not necessarily and answer because there is something enjoyable in the process of learning. 

发言人2   02:49:11
in trying to decide for what's happening. Possibly also, dad tries not too hard to teach people things . 

发言人1   02:49:17
I don't want to. 

发言人2   02:49:18
I don't want to be that he helps them to sol problem when you have problems and you constantly have problems, so if you come to dad, dad can help explain to you how he would solve the problem, but most the time they don't want to solve the problem, so sometimes they have to play dumb s like, why is my wife I not working on my computer? I don't know. Did you click on that thing? 

发言人1   02:49:37
You've got like a rebellion, sovereign child, sovereign as they may be. But sometimes they still need the yeah yeah that to step. 

发言人2   02:49:43
So in addition to feeling love in having high south of steam, I think the most important trait that would be nice to not rob them of this agency, I want them to preserve their agency. They're born naturally, agents and willful le, but a lot of child raising beat that added than by essentially domesticating them straight. And I would rather have wild animals involves, then have well trained dogs because i'm not going to be around to take care of them. 

发言人1   02:50:09
are going to to be . 

发言人2   02:50:10
able to look after exactly friend of my partha on on air chat, uh, he had a great saying, he said he wants his uh, children to be quick to learn and hard to kill. 

发言人1   02:50:23
Was pretty good. Yeah, that's cool. I remember you saying just thinking about sort of future and culture and stuff like that. I remember saying that the left ted on the culture war, another just driving around shooting the survivors after the last six months have changed that we've seen in sort of a way we at at the moment what do you think the future of the culture well, looks like . 

发言人2   02:50:43
it's not over yet. Um they definitely won earlier around. They took our institutions. I think now it's much more of a fair fight um where you have people like elon, you know I have supporting uh so so there's this different forces through history right historians will argue about this uh but there is a fear of the greek man of history thing where it's like, oh you the eines steins you have the text as you have the um the jack us coins and the scissors right they determine the flow of history and then there's the other uh point of view that no, there are these massive forces at play, you know demographics and geography and so on and then the particular great man doesn't matter, they just come and go in a polian doesn't matter, there would have been somebody else. Uh, the specific named are not important. 

发言人2   02:51:28
And because of kind of the left just turn that our institutions took in the last few h decades, they now only describe to the great forces theory of history, not the great man theory of history. But I think now we're seeing the two play out where you're seeing tron and the individuals rising up and saying, no, we resist you and I think that unfortunately, into the battle, we look collectivists and grade forces versus individuals. IT is all the humid itself, and and IT is fundamental to the species. 

发言人2   02:51:59
We are not completely individualism species. You know, no man is an ideal, and a single person can do anything by themselves. But we're also not aboard. 

发言人2   02:52:07
We're not a beef. We're not an economy. We're not all just drones marching along. 

发言人2   02:52:12
So which is IT where we are somewhere in the middle. And the human race is always kind of bouncing between the two. We like strong leaders. We like to be LED um we like to ordinate our forces and and mass and and do things um but at the same time, we're also all individuals and willing to break away and willing to do our own thing and everyone's always fighting to be leaders and always status games going on. So uh where there's a pension is always winging back and forth. 

发言人2   02:52:36
And in modern economics, the way that manifest is between the marxism and capitalism, right? Marxism is like from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs were all equal. This a milano project. 

发言人2   02:52:47
We're all going to be equal in the end and you know don't try and to stand out but do what's good for everybody um and there's a religious aspect to IT and then the capitalist individualist is like laboratory and every man for itself each do what you want and will work out for the greater good that's adam Smith you know the invisible hand of the market will feed you. The Baker should bake and the bucher should witcher and the the stick makers should make canal sticks and all work out. Each person does their best in their trade and so which is IT, which which which which theory is correct. 

发言人2   02:53:14
And I think there's always going to be a battle between the two. And I think. The interesting thing is what's going on, there's a modern flavor to IT, which changes IT. 

发言人2   02:53:28
The modern flavor is that the individual is getting more powerful because they're becoming more leverage. So someone like an elan mosque can have the leverage of tens of thousands of brilliant engineers and producers working for him. He can have factories of robots manufacturing things. 

发言人2   02:53:43
He can have hundreds of billions of stars of capital behind him, and he can project himself through media to hundreds amounts of people that is more power than any individual could have had historically. So the great men of history are becoming greater. That said, that same leverage is increasing the gap between the haves and have nots. 

发言人2   02:54:02
So in the wealth game, more people are winning. Overall, the average is going up. But in status game, they are essentially more losers. 

发言人2   02:54:08
They are more invisible men and women who are getting nothing out of life. And I have no leverage, relatively speaking. Objectively speaking, they might . 

发言人1   02:54:18
be Better off. They still . 

发言人2   02:54:20
have phones, and they have tent and winners. And in a democracy, those people will outnumber the winners, and they will vote the winners down. And so that's the battle that kind of goes on and the democracy has gotten very brought. 

发言人2   02:54:35
And so one of my other quips is that um it's not the right to vote that gives you power. It's power that gives you the right to vote. So we'll confuse the two. 

发言人2   02:54:46
So what happened was in a voting started as a way for people who had power to divide up the power, not fight among themselves. The winners of the revolution, the winners of the war, the people in the house of lords and the house of commons, they divide a power among the themselves. They say, hey, we have all the money, we have the power. 

发言人2   02:55:02
We are the nights. We have the sorts, we have the warriors. We could kill everybody. 

发言人2   02:55:07
We don't want to just fight to all day long. We want to be game of thrones forever. So we might divide up power by body ourselves. But then our society goes on and becomes more and more peaceful. 

发言人2   02:55:16
That franchise for voting get spread to get spread to people who don't have land, who don't have power, who may not be able to inflict physical violence, and then eventually get to the point where everybody's voting, every boy's voting, everybody is voting for a Candy and fairs, and you all the three things in life, uh, and then eventually people started voting to oppress each other. The fifty one percent in in any domain vote to the the forty nine tyranny majority. But not all of them are wouldn't to back that up with physical power. 

发言人2   02:55:44
And so you can end up in a situation where people who don't have physical power are using the institutions of the state to control the people who do have physical power. As a simple example, taking this, the people who don't have guns voting to disarm the people that do have guns, right? Well, if the people who do have guns get coordinate are enough, you can do that, right? So I think eventually these societal structures are unstable. 

发言人2   02:56:07
They break down. And they break down because eventually the people who have the power and say, no, well met, you don't get to vote. You you only got to vote because you have power. 

发言人2   02:56:14
And now you don't have power, you're somehow trying to vote. All of nature, all of society, all of capitalism, all of human endeavors are underpin by physical violence. And that is very hard truth to swallow and hard to get away from. 

发言人2   02:56:28
Nature is reading tooth and claw. If you don't t you don't survive, you live, you die. And that's true of everything alive today, and humans are no different. 

发言人2   02:56:37
So giving up physical power and then thinking you can exercise political power failed. Which is why every communist revolution, which is all about equality in combi, I and brother and sisters, end up being run by a bunch of thugs. Because if you don't have a way to divide IT up the wealth based on merit, then is always going to be based on power and influence. 

发言人2   02:56:55
The dogs with the guns always win the end. So the question is just, can you keep the thugs and book with the guns paid and happy and successful society where you allocating based on merit? Because if you can, then you do a bed in power. So I do think that this battle is not over, but that's because IT IT never stopped. It's always been there from day one. 

发言人1   02:57:13
IT will continue. Is IT a battle to not care about the news? In the age of news saturation, all of this stuff headlines twenty four hours a day, stream directly into your consciousness through a device in your pocket. 

发言人1   02:57:24
You, a lot. What we're spoken about today is freedom. Freedom from having to think about things I care about, things you do not have control over all that you shouldn't or that you don't want to. 

发言人1   02:57:33
yet. People are just like submerged up to the bottom of their nostros, basically drowning in worry. So how yeah is is IT a battle to sort of stay out of the news when you're saturated in IT? 

发言人2   02:57:45
Yeah mean as you're saying, the human brain is not evolved to handle all the world's emergencies breaking in real time and you can't care about everything and you're going insane if you try um doesn't mean you shouldn't care at all. No should. I mean, if you want to care, go and care. 

发言人2   02:58:00
I would just say that you're probably Better off only caring about things that are local or things that can affect. So if you really care about something that in the news, then by all means care about IT, but make a difference go do something about IT and make sure that it's your overwhelming desire and you don't have five of the desire at the same time。Um also just really the consequences of IT are going to be happy until that thing gets fixed and that thing will often be at your control. 

发言人1   02:58:24
Desire is a contract to be unhappy until you get what you want but exit for the most part that something that is in your life. It's like till I lose the weight, until I get the . 

发言人2   02:58:33
job the outside either . 

发言人1   02:58:34
yeah if it's until the carbon dioxide ts per million or below this particular number, like that's a that's a tough . 

发言人2   02:58:41
one or all the people who trump arrangement center or right, he's living rent free in their heads and driving them insane. And I get IT I mean there are politicians who would have definitely driven me say as well um but IT comes at a very high cost is something that is out of your control that you cannot really influence um so it's probably good to at least . 

发言人1   02:59:00
be kind this of IT you mentioned a historians before one of my friends has AA question, his equivalent of AP details question, what is that that you believe that most people would disagree with? This is, what do you think is currently ignored by the media, but will be studied by historians. 

发言人2   02:59:19
Hm, you asking me that question right now, what do I think I is ignored by the media. 

发言人1   02:59:23
but that will be studied by historians? 

发言人2   02:59:26
Well, I mean, the media is only focused on very timely things, right? So IT IT depends who you want to talk about timely or timeless, right? But as as a simple example, if I just look at things that maybe the next five or ten years that are going to make a massive difference that people are not focused enough on um and I think within two years this will be obvious. So like that, then I make your prediction. Predictions are tough. 

发言人1   02:59:55
but you wait in a . 

发言人2   02:59:56
few years. So i'm probably wrong. But two things that I pay attention to um that I don't think uh, a lot of people do pay attention to. 

发言人2   03:00:04
Well, there's a couple. One is, I think, just how bad modern medicine is. I think people just put a lot more faith in modern medicine. 

发言人2   03:00:11
Then is warrant ted like our best ideas for a lot of things or surgery, just cutting things out, uh, treating things that are extra anise like, oh, you don't really need a gold blade, you don't really need a pendus, so you don't really need TCL or that's false. Every little human bodies, very fishing, all those things are needed. You know, I think, I think the state of modern medicine are pretty bad. 

发言人2   03:00:31
We don't have many good explanatory theories in biology. Um we have germ theory disease. We have a evolution. 

发言人2   03:00:38
We have, uh south theory, we have DNA genetics. A more genesis and biogenesis, not much else, not much else. Everything else is rules of the memorization a effects b is defect sea effects d. But we don't understand the underlying explanation. It's all just words point to words point to words. 

发言人2   03:00:57
So biology is still in a very sorry state and because we are not like to take risk that might kill people, um we just don't experiment enough and biology so a lot of treatments are just out right band by large ing a tree body. So we just don't have the innovation. So I think we are still the stone age when IT comes to biology, and we ve got a long way to go. 

发言人2   03:01:15
And I think people will look back a gas at this and I think this is brian johns's point. He's like let's be more more extreme left a little IT, be more experimental and I all start this end of one to start experimenting on myself in um but even there I disagree with brian and many things like, you know taking a huge amount of supplements. I think we just don't know supplements outside the natural context, like just deliver man, right um but it's fine and and I ouldn't be vegan either, but II really appreciate that his experimenting is good. 

发言人2   03:01:43
Nature about me shares everything, so we need more people like that. Um so I think the state of biology people will look back and say, well, that was in the dark ages. Um I think um another another thing that will look back on and I think we still have important drones are gonna in warfare. 

发言人2   03:02:02
The future of all warfare is drones. There will be nothing else in the battle field um because I think of the n state of drones as autonomous bullets, not even guide autonomous like there's self directed. Uh and so if that's the future we're . 

发言人1   03:02:16
headed towards . 

发言人2   03:02:17
and that is aircraft Carriers, tanks, infinity men, they're just going to be autonomous bullets by autonomous butts against your autonomous bullets, whichever ones the wind the other side just surrender is over. Um I think that's a second piece of IT. I think AA third piece that is going to be uh kind of unexpected is the GLP ones, which I know you I privately discussed before. 

发言人2   03:02:39
I think these are the most breakthrough drugs since any biotics um they're probably more important than status s their sort of miracle drugs. They seem to there are downsides, but the downside effects are some liner compared to the upsides beyond just weight loss. Um they also seem to be addiction brokers. They seem to lower many kinds of cancer. They almost metall icc reverse aging. Up to a certain point um and I think they're to be the curve on health care costs and h the big question people can be asking or the next five years, why are americans paying thousands of dollars and months for this when people overseas are getting them for free or I can order them from china for free or whatever? 

发言人2   03:03:15
Um and maybe uh like if I were berny Sanders, the platform I would be running on, as I would say, okay, we're going na pay for us you know hundreds of billions of dollars to novo and and words can make these free or this hundreds of analysts with these things that were if they are not going to be you know limited to just the few that are that are being used today, just take one of them or two of them can free. And I think you make a big difference. And uh, as you and I were discussing earlier, uh, this does spend a lot of people at a shape who got to the old fashion way. And they want to see obesity as a moral fAiling on people's . 

发言人1   03:03:52
parts and IT . 

发言人2   03:03:53
lose their status if they are a nal indo possible cancer. Have fun losing bone and muscle mass. But then none of that stuff is really true. 

发言人2   03:04:04
The cancer stuff is actually beneficial on, I know people who are now taking these things for anti aging reasons. Um they're already fit but they just want to age Better and have a stronger and slow metabolism. Um and there's evidence now these things um you know they put off dementia, alzheimer's, colon cancer, it's insane, cardiovascular disease like that. 

发言人2   03:04:23
The list of benefits is insane. There's no free lunch, but this is a classic drugs that prevents you from taking other drugs into your body. IT prevents you from taking, uhh, you know, too much sugar, too much, too many calories and euro abundance prevents you from smoking, prevents you from even, uh, there is an organization called kasper that is not doing a study on heroin addictions and they're showing that this can lower uh, oppoi overdoses and iron editions. 

发言人2   03:04:52
So there's a lot of overwhelmed medical evidence coming out. And I think II don't know the exact number, but I think something like ten percent of the population might not have tried. I think the that I think it's about . 

发言人1   03:05:04
fifty percent of the population say that they would like to try IT. 

发言人2   03:05:07
exactly. So I think the body positivity movement is dead. We always kind of knew was a scared. 

发言人1   03:05:13
I mean, it's dying very. 

发言人2   03:05:14
very quickly, I quipped, like, you can never be too rich, too fine or too clean, right? And immediately, like a whole budge, people went none, only my mentions. Like, what do you mean to thin? And what about the hygiene y pothead is? And you know, obviously exceptions. 

发言人2   03:05:27
People want to be thin fit and people want to be cleaned back to the passage and discussion that we had. So I think overall, that there is going to be huge demand for these things, and our modern medical system is not built to supply these. Well, i'm III don't hold that against the farmers. 

发言人2   03:05:44
I think the farmers did their job by creating the thing. But I think next we need to step up and figure how to make IT broadly and cheaply available as opposed to you just milk IT for only for you know, people on obesity, you can get medicare to sign off for IT or people paying out of pocket at a very, very high Price. Yeah, the benefits of societal distribution of the safer G, L, P. Ones is so large that whatever politicians are tackles, that is going to be Richard rewarded. 

发言人1   03:06:12
But obesity is the number source of malnutrition worldwide. This twice as many people that are obese than are starving. So about half a billion people are starving . 

发言人2   03:06:21
in a billion people. Problems are downstream of that. Like you look at how much of the federal budget causing diospolis kidney failure and why diabetes. So so many of the problems that we have in my side of a down's stream of obesity, and you know this like fitness is so important. 

发言人2   03:06:35
And yes, there's in some people, these things called me, caused muscle and bone loss, but not in the people who reading high protein, working out hard so they can be taken away. That's safer. And some versions of these, like a little glue tie, the original one, they've been around for decades. 

发言人2   03:06:50
And the others have been run for about a decade. And we already have, as you said, ten percent of population taking them. So they are already quite widely direct. 

发言人2   03:06:57
Good sample size. Yeah it's a great sample size. More do you need like if if you if you have a back turn infection that's eating you, I don't say, oh, I have this. 

发言人2   03:07:05
Anybody please not raise your blood pressures that if you're gonna kill yourself, I say take this anecdotic and stay alive longer and solve IT I don't say, oh, it's gonna cause your heart rate to go up by three beats a minute. I don't worry about that. So similarly, if you're poisoning yourself with toxins and overuse of substances, you shouldn't be using either hero and alcohol, cigarettes, sugar or just sheer calories. 

发言人2   03:07:28
Um take this GLP one. Uh they also improved digestion. You just have less, less food matter going to demise the lower cancer risks across the board. 

发言人2   03:07:38
There's quite a few cancers. The lower um cardiff aska. II mean, I don't know what else to . 

发言人1   03:07:43
tell you have been very surprised by the negative reception whenever you have a conversation about GLP ones. And I think a lot of maybe . 

发言人2   03:07:50
people who in do . 

发言人1   03:07:52
well think about . 

发言人2   03:07:53
how many sacred cows are being gored, right? All the people who are basically saying, uh, you should work harder, you should be fit like I did, right? It's lerrys their status. Think about all the nutritionists and doctors and trainers who are now being, you know, it's too easy there have been put out of business in a way, right uh, it's like what does the american military keep buying aircraft Carriers right in nature of drones um is an incentive bias is a very strong motivated reasoning. Uh but IT doesn't matter, ten percent people on IT uh everybody wants to be fit. 

发言人1   03:08:27
It's going to spread like welfare. I was just thinking, as you were talking, that you know we think about health and a lot of people kind of get captured, by the way, that they were brought up the the habits that they had from the childhood or what mom, dad did or genetic predisposition and stuff like that. I think um you have as many reasons as as many people to sort of feel hard done by by chAllenges that you had earlier on in in your life is getting past your past a skill so if not being owned today by your history, so of not having that hood mentality. 

发言人2   03:09:01
Yeah I did have a tough childhood, but I don't think about IT. You know I think there are a couple of things going on there. One is I did process that quite a bit. 

发言人2   03:09:11
I thought about IT, but I thought about IT to get rid of IT. I don't think about IT to do on IT. Yeah, I wanted to be successful. 

发言人2   03:09:18
I wanted more than anything else to rise, pass that. And so I couldn't have that as a burden on me. So I to get rid of IT. 

发言人2   03:09:24
So to the extent that I dealt with IT, IT was IT was for the express purpose of getting rid of IT, not to create identity or story or reflect upon IT, or to say, look at me. Look at what i've accomplish. Look how great I am, what i've done. 

发言人2   03:09:36
I got rid of IT. And I think at some point you restful with that thing. And I just realized you're never gna tangle. The whole thing is a problem. 

发言人2   03:09:43
Uh, like Alexander, you fun that tangled not in india and uh, that said, oh, the famous conquer will come and will untie this. Not nobody just can until not take one look at a pull out the store, just cut IT. So at some point you have to cut your past. 

发言人2   03:09:56
If your past is bothering you, you will eventually get tired to try to tangle that not, and you will just drop IT because you will. Real life is short, and the more you have more you want to accomplish in this life, actually, the last time you have to unravel that thing. So I just wanted to actually get things done. 

发言人2   03:10:11
So I had no time to deal with that. I just cut IT. It's like a really bad relationship, but in this case, a bad relationship with their own history. 

发言人1   03:10:19
So you just drop IT. Yeah, I think you know so much of what we spoken about today is on the shortness of life and the fact that every moment is precious you have to take about that. The most fundamental resource in your life is not time and attention. 

发言人2   03:10:35
right? I used to think of the currency of life, right? People think it's money. And yes, money is important. And he does let you trade certain things for a time. 

发言人2   03:10:43
But IT doesn't really buy you time as warn buffs how much time money can buy you. Or Michael bloomberg, they are, you know, richest cw and crisis, but they can buy more time, right? Brian Johnson not withstanding. 

发言人2   03:10:55
Um so you can't trade money for time. Money is not the real currency of life and time itself. Does that mean that much? Because as we talked about before, a lot of time can be wasted because you're not really present for IT, you're not paying attention. 

发言人2   03:11:13
So the real currency of life is attention, is what you choose to pay attention to and and and what you do about IT. And so back to the point about the news media, you can put your attention on the news, but that's how you're spending the real currency of life. So just be aware of that if you want to. 

发言人2   03:11:31
That's fine. There's no no right or wrong here like maybe IT is your destiny to pick something in the news, to learn about that problem, adopt that problem and solve IT. But just be careful because your attention is the only thing that you have and . 

发言人1   03:11:44
that can also be capture by your own past. Yes. 

发言人2   03:11:46
you can filter IT away anything you'd like if you're . 

发言人1   03:11:49
an advantage to starting out as a loser. 

发言人2   03:11:52
Ah absolutely yeah yeah because of you because if you are loser, then you will want to be a winner and then you'll develop all the characteristics that'll help you be a quote and quote winner in life. That said, I wouldn't sense my kids to IT I don't think can artificially do that. 

发言人2   03:12:07
It's it's like imagine that you you know three hundred years ago you're born to surf and then somehow you managed to escape off the farm and you become a landowner and that eventually you become minor ability to you going to put your kids back on the farm so you're going to be a surfer again. I know they all like those stories. The kids themselves like those stories because he says, I came from the school head. 

发言人2   03:12:26
We go shovel hay for a summer. It's not real. I mean like trick them. Um I think what you can all you can do is kind of uh cultivate and appreciation and gratitude for what you have. 

发言人2   03:12:37
And the only way to do that is just evidence at yourself, right? Just show yourself how you spend money. How you respect is what you do with that, how you take care of people who you responsible for. 

发言人2   03:12:49
The more resources you have, the greater the tribe you can take care of, the more of the tribe you can take care of. So when you have no resources, you struggling to take care yourself. And at that point, it's good to be selfish because you can't save somebody else if you can even save yourself, yes, so you take care of yourself and you become the best version of yourself. 

发言人2   03:13:07
But there are too many men who are able fit and have some money, who are doing nothing with their lives. They are just sitting at home doing nothing, just indulging in themselves, move to going dates, and they get ash. Like, I have no respect for that, I think is nothing worse than society than a lazy man because he's so of he's sort of leaving at all on the table. Leaving his potential in the table was bad for him. 

发言人2   03:13:27
So the next thing you do is you go in your family and you take care of your family, take care that tribe, then you take care of extended family, take care your thousands, brothers, uncles, grandmother's s aunts, you know sisters, everybody that you can, and then if you have more research beyond, then you go take care of your local tribe, take care of your people um you start trying to do some good for the world if you have more resort that you go take here and you and bigger try and that's how you earn both respect and self confidence and you live up to your potential. So the the more you have, the more is rightfully expected of you. And I think it's a good compact with society when highly capable of people express and flex that capability by giving more and more and by doing more and more. 

发言人2   03:14:07
And society rewards them with the one thing they can get othe wise of the status, right? Society should give you status exchange for IT. They should say, okay, you did a good job you to care more people than than just yourself and just did people immediate around you and that's what an alphabetic ale to me is.

An alpha male is not the one who gets to eat first. The alpa a male eats last. The male feeds everybody else first and then gets to eat last. And they do that out of their own self respect and pride. And the city rewards them by calling them an out and giving them status.

It's happening at the society level as well, correct? I mean, the guys make a lot of money and go up by sports teams. I won't do that right. But the one who goes out and builds a hospital or bills a rocket to take people to the moon, you know, rest you a question as you should be rewarding him for that.
